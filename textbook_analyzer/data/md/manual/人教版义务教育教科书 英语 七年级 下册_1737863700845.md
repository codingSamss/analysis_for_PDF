### Read Malee’s post and choose the best title for it.  

A.	What Is an Elephant? B.	My Favourite Animal: The Elephant C.	How to Save Elephants  

Hi, I’m Malee and I live in Thailand!  

The elephant is my favourite animal. I love elephants because they are strong and clever. They are also a symbol of good luck here. The elephant is our national animal. On 13 March, we celebrate Thai Elephant Day.  

Elephants look very different from other animals. They are huge. They have large ears and long trunks. They can pick up and carry heavy things with their trunks.  

Elephants are like us in some ways. They are very playful and love to play in the water. They are great swimmers. They are also clever. For example, they can remember one another and places with food and water after many years. Elephants are very kind too. They look after other elephants when they don’t feel well. The big elephants also help the baby ones.  

Elephants are an important part of Thai life and culture. However, they are in danger. They live in forests, but people cut down too many trees. People also kill elephants for their ivory. Let’s save the forests and not buy things made of ivory. Every elephant counts.

Dear Dr Know,  

Help! There are too many rules in my life! Every morning, I have to make my bed before breakfast. I have to hurry to school because I can’t be late for school. When I’m at school, I mustn’t use my phone in class either. And I have to wear the uniform.  

After school, there are even more rules! I have to finish my homework first. I can only play basketball after I practise the piano. I can’t hang out with my friends on weekdays. I know some rules are important, but this is awful! What can I do?  

Yours,  

Alice  

Dear Alice,  

Yes, there are many rules in life! But they can help you to become a better person.  

You mustn’t be late for class. That shows respect for your class and teacher.   
You can’t use your phone in class because you need to focus on learning.   
You have to wear a uniform because it builds school spirit.  

You can also think about the things you can do! You can use your phone at home. You can relax after you finish your homework. And you can hang out with friends at weekends!  

I know it’s hard, but rules can help to make the world better. Remember: No rules, no order!

Dear Dr Know,  

Can you help me? I follow too many rules at home and at   
school. I clean my room every day, and I let my   
desk get untidy. At school, I wear my own clothes. I   
wear my favourite cap either. After school, I watch TV, but only   
after I finish my homework, walk the dog, and do lots of other things!   
I can’t even relax at weekends, because I practise   
the violin every day! I never have fun. What I do?   
Yours,   
Eric

I love jogging! I jog in the park near my home in the morning. The air is clean, and I can hear birds singing. I jog in the evening after work, but I jog when I’m tired. I jog in the afternoon on working days because I’m busy then. It’s easy to go jogging. You just need running shoes. I jog three times a week or more. I’m full of energy after jogging. Keeping fit is not that hard!

 Xia Tian  

I like very much. My friends and I practise at a special park twice a week. My skateboard is really cool, and so are theirs. We encourage one another to do tricks. Some tricks are difficult, but once you succeed, you feel great! I like skateboarding because it keeps me fit.

This year, my goal is to be really fit. I jog, swim, and do sit-ups. But my favourite way of keeping fit is to to work out. The app gives me exercises to do  

every day. It can show my progress. My friends use the app too. We have fun when we keep fit together!  

I’m in my school’s baseball club, so I quite often. It’s my favourite sport. We play many matches. The other teams are great, but I think ours is the best! We usually practise three times a week after school. We also exercise a lot because it keeps us fit and helps us play better.

Baseball also builds team spirit. All of us are good friends, both on and off the field. We work as a team, and we win or lose as a team.

 Improve Your Eating Habits  

Healthy eating is important for a healthy body and mind. Both what we eat and how we eat are important!  

For example, some people have fast food every week. It is easy and delicious! But it often has lots of salt, fat, and sugar. That makes us put on weight. Eating fast food like pizza and hamburgers too often may cause heart problems later. If you cook your own meals instead, you can make healthy balanced meals.  

Eating three meals a day is important. But some people don’t have breakfast. Maybe they don’t feel hungry in the morning, or they are too busy to eat anything. But food gives us energy. It is easy to feel sleepy and find it hard to focus on our work or studies if we don’t eat breakfast.  

Some people also eat too many sweet things. Ice cream, sweets, and chocolate are delicious, but they usually have lots of sugar. This can cause tooth problems. When you want a snack, why don’t you have some fruit instead? After all, an apple a day keeps the doctor away.  

Remember: You are what you eat. Healthy eating means eating healthy food and having good eating habits.

Lisa  

I have some good eating habits. I eat three meals a day, and I have them on time. I eat a lot of vegetables too. Some of my friends don’t like carrots or other vegetables, and they don’t eat them, but I eat all kinds of vegetables.  

However, I have some bad eating habits too. First, I drink too many soft drinks. I love soft drinks because they taste so good! But soft drinks usually have a lot of sugar. They’re bad for me. Second, I don’t drink enough water. I drink water when I am thirsty, but it’s better to drink before I get thirsty. In future, I should drink more water.

### Read Sam’s diary entry and write a one-sentence summary of what he did on that day.  

Friday, 30 May  

Today we went on a school trip to a farm! It was tiring but great fun! In the morning, we explored the farm. There were large tents with tomatoes, cucumbers, and many other fruits and vegetables. The farmer told us about how these fruits and vegetables go from the fields to our tables. I was very interested because I usually only see them in the supermarket.  

Then we got straight to work! First, we picked some strawberries. The work seemed easy, but it took time to get it right. Slowly, we filled many baskets. In the afternoon, the farmer taught us how to cut branches and leaves from tomato plants. This helps them to grow more fruit. Finally, we watered the plants. Plants need so much work! It was tiring, but I enjoyed working with my hands.  

One thing I learnt today: Farming isn’t easy! It made me think of the saying,“Every grain comes from hard work.”The farmer let us take some vegetables home. My mum cooked some for dinner, and they were fresh and delicious! They certainly taste better when you work for them! Today was really a day to remember.

Once upon a time, there was a mother duck. She had six little ducklings. Five of the ducklings were small and yellow, but the last duckling was big and grey. “He doesn’t look like us! What an ugly duckling!” the other ducklings said. “That’s not nice!” said Mother Duck. “He’s still a duck like us!”  

At the river, the ugly duckling swam well, just like all the other ducklings. But the other ducklings still laughed at him and told him to go away. It made the poor duckling very sad, so he decided to search for a new home. He met many other birds, but all of them thought that he was ugly too. They did not want him to live with them.  

One day, the duckling met a cat and a hen. “May I stay with you?” he asked hopefully. But the two animals said no. They did not like him because he could not purr or lay eggs!  

Some days later, the ugly duckling came to a lake. There, he saw three beautiful swans with long necks and white feathers. “I wish I looked like you!” he cried. “My friend, you do look like us! Look in the water!” one of the swans said. The duckling looked down, and to his surprise, he saw that he was a beautiful white swan too!

“Prepare to die!” shouted the genie. “A long time ago, I made a promise. If someone set me free, I would make them rich and powerful. But no one ever came. After years and years of waiting, I became very angry. If anyone set me free, I would kill them instead of giving them anything. So, you must die!”

### The Amazing Octopus  

Among the many amazing animals in the world, few are as strange and unusual as the octopus. There are around 300 different kinds of octopuses, and they come in all sizes! The smallest is only around 2.5 centimetres long, but some octopuses can grow up to more than five metres long. There was even an octopus over nine metres long!  

The octopus’s body is very interesting. All octopuses have eight arms. Their brain is not just in their head, but also in their arms! This helps them to think about and do more than one thing at once. Octopuses can also fit into small places because they do not have any bones! And did you know that octopuses have three hearts? These hearts work with different parts of the body.  

Octopuses can also do many amazing things. Most of them can change their colour and shape to look like plants or other sea animals, and they can also make ink. They keep it inside a very small bag in their body. When they produce ink, the ink makes it hard for other animals to see them. This helps the octopuses to get away fast. What’s more, when an octopus loses an arm, it can grow it back!  

Studying amazing animals like the octopus is important because we can learn a lot from them. But they also show us how wonderful nature is and why it is important to protect it!

# Unit 3  

## Healthy Body, Healthy Mind  

We all know exercise is important, yet we don’t always want to do it! Often we are too busy or feel lazy. But we should try our best to exercise every day.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/26b787b5-8c2d-44a8-9e95-a8f2db3642c5/ae1f7c60df819a0881d3b35b592086593f3c5841d40905dea07ad5b54272daa5.jpg)  

Exercise is good for our body. When we exercise, our body changes. Exercise develops our muscles and makes us stronger. When we exercise, we use energy. This keeps our weight down. Being overweight puts stress on our body. It can cause pain in our back and knees, and even cause more serious problems such as heart disease later in life.  

Exercise is also great for our brain. During exercise, our heart beats faster and we breathe harder. Our brain gets more oxygen because of this, and that helps our memory improve. Scientists also tell us the body makes more of certain chemicals after exercise. This helps us to learn and think well. So, when you have trouble with your homework, do some exercise, then try again!  

Exercise also helps us to feel happier. When we exercise, our brain makes special chemicals. These chemicals can relax our body and calm our mind. Feeling fit can also make us feel better and more confident about ourselves. When we play a sport with others, we can even make new friends.  

Remember: Health is wealth. The more you exercise, the healthier you become. Try to make exercise a part of your life.

### Food Myths  

 “Only fruit and vegetables are healthy foods.”  

The human body needs to eat many different types of food to stay healthy. The Chinese Food Guide Pagoda shows us what food we should eat. While fruit and vegetables are healthy choices, it is just as important to eat foods from other food groups. Milk,

for example, contains many nutrients and is good for our bones. We should include milk or dairy products among the things we eat.  

 “Eating fat makes you fat.”  

Eating fat is important for keeping us healthy. It gives us energy and helps our body to take in nutrients. Not all fat makes us gain weight. Some fat can even encourage our body to lose weight. It is necessary to include some, but not too much, fat in our food to help our body work well.  

 “It’s OK to eat only what I like while I’m young.”  

When we are young, it might feel like we can just eat whatever we want! For example, sweets and fried foods taste delicious. But we cannot eat those foods alone. Eating balanced meals is very important when we are young. It helps our body and brain to grow well. Bad eating habits may stay with us our whole life, so it is best to develop good eating habits early!

“Nihao! It’s Liu Meng from Shanghai. Right now my family and I are visiting friends in Canada. We’re all on a tour of the Niagara Falls. It’s amazing! We’re on a boat close to the falls. The water’s pouring fast over the falls. It’s so powerful! We’re wearing raincoats but are still getting very wet! We’re having great fun anyway!”

The sun is shining and it’s really hot, but there are still lots of people here. Some people are swimming and playing in the water, and others are sunbathing or playing games on the beach. My uncle is teaching me how to surf. It’s tricky, but I think I’m making good progress. It feels great to ride the waves!”

## Unit 6  

### Weather and Mood  

Do you know how weather affects our lives? Well, it affects where we go, what we do, and what we wear. And it also affects how we feel and behave. It is a big part of our lives!  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/26b787b5-8c2d-44a8-9e95-a8f2db3642c5/38ff42e8995a8b18c35ff91dc6d31c7f67a51eee39fd6b96ca3e5b268781ce9b.jpg)  

We often use weather language to describe how we feel. For example, if we are feeling ill, we say we are “under the weather”. If we are feeling stressed and busy, we can say that we are “snowed under”. We use “bad” weather (rainy, stormy, etc.) to describe a bad mood, and “good” weather (sunny, warm, etc.) to describe a good mood.  

And that is not all. The weather can even change the way we feel! For example, sunlight helps our body to produce vitamin D. This vitamin can improve our mood. But some parts of the world get little sunlight in winter, so people can feel unusually sad then. However, when it is hot and sunny, some people may get angry easily too! Scientists are still studying how the weather changes the way people feel and behave.  

These days, many of us spend less time outside than in the past. Getting no fresh air or sunlight and spending too much time inside can make us feel down. It is very important to go outside once in a while, whatever the weather, rain or shine!  

### Read the text and correct the statements.  

1.	 The weather doesn’t really affect how we feel and behave.   
2.	 If we are feeling ill, we can say that we are “snowed under”.   
3.	 We use sunny or warm weather to describe negative moods.   
4.	 Darkness helps us produce more vitamin D.   
​5​.	 We can feel down if we spend too much time outside.  

### 2 Use a dictionary to help you match the weather idioms with their meanings. Then find more weather idioms and share them with a partner.  

1.	 to brighten up A.	to feel healthy or well again   
2.	 to be on cloud nine B.	to become happier   
3.	 to feel as right as rain C.	to be extremely happy and excited   
4.	 to be in a fog D.	to be confused  

## Unit 7  

### Wednesday, 22 July  

Today was an amazing day. There was a total solar eclipse in Wuhan! I woke up early because I couldn’t wait to see it!  

My friends and I went down to the Yangtze River to find a good place to watch it. We took cameras, chairs, food and drink, and special glasses so we could look at it. Lots of people gathered there to watch too. Slowly, the moon moved in front of the sun. It looked like someone bit a hole in the sun! It got darker and darker as the moon slowly covered the sun.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/26b787b5-8c2d-44a8-9e95-a8f2db3642c5/46caf93dd54dcc3ec35b219f4006485d8967eb3a2115053598db5f7ef8d7bc9a.jpg)  

At 9:26 a.m. the moon completely covered the sun. The sky went dark. The crowd gasped and cheered. The light of the sun made a ring of light around the moon. I took this photograph then. The total eclipse lasted for over five minutes! Then it passed and the sky started to get brighter again.  

I was really inspired by the eclipse this morning. In the afternoon, I spent hours reading about astronomers, eclipses, and how the planets move in our solar system. The universe is simply amazing! I also watched some videos with famous Chinese astronauts. I want to become an astronaut or astronomer someday too. The sky is the limit!  

### Read Lisa’s diary entry and answer the questions.  

1.	 ​Where did Lisa and her friends watch the eclipse? ​2.	 Why did Lisa and her friends take special glasses with them? ​3.	 How long did the total eclipse last for? ​4.	 What did Lisa want to be when she grew up?  

### 2 Think of some memorable events. What was special about them? Share your story.

Scene One [The fisherman’s hut.]  

Fisherman:	 An amazing thing happened when I went fishing today! I caught a little golden fish. It could speak! It promised me whatever I wanted if I set it free. Wife: At last, fortune smiles upon us! What did you wish for? Fisherman:	 Well … I felt sorry for the fish, so I just put it back into the sea. Narrator: His wife was very angry and made him find the fish.  

Scene Two [By the sea.]  

Fisherman: Little golden fish, are you there?  

Golden fish:	 Hello, kind fisherman. What’s the matter?

Scene Three	[The fisherman’s hut.]  

Narrator:​ Back home, the fisherman found a new pot outside the house.  

Fisherman:​ Look, a new pot!  

Wife:	​ You fool! Can’t you see we need a new house instead? Go back again and ask for one!  

Scene Four​ [By the sea.]  

Fisherman:​	 Little golden fish, are you still there?  

Golden fish:​	 Hello again, kind fisherman.  

Fisherman:​	 My wife wants a new house! Can you help me please?  

Narrator: Again, the golden fish granted his wish.  

Scene Five [The fisherman’s hut.]  

Narrator: The fisherman went back home. But his house was now big and beautiful.

Anna:	​ It’s hot and sunny. It’s about $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .  

Bill:	​ That’s nice! What are you doing at the beach?  

Anna:	​ I’m sunbathing at the moment! My brother John’s here too.  

Bill:	​ Oh, what’s he doing?  

Anna:	​ He’s playing beach volleyball right now. What about you? How’s the weather in Stockholm?  

Bill:	​ Well, it’s cold and snowy. It’s about $- 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$  

Anna:	​ Oh, that’s really cold! What’s your family doing?  

Bill:	​ Well, we usually stay in when it snows, but now we’re building a snowman outside. Hey, come and visit us some day!  

Anna:	​ OK. Once the weather turns warm!  

## Unit 7  A Day to Remember  

### Section A, 1b and 1c Conversation 1  

Yaming:	​ Hi, Peter. How was your weekend?  

Peter:	​ It was great! I visited the science museum.  

Yaming:	​ Did you see anything interesting?  

Peter:	​ Yes, there was a space exhibition. There were some special rooms, and they looked like parts of a space station. You could go inside them and see how astronauts live and work! It was amazing.  

Yaming:	​ Cool! Were there any astronauts there?  

Peter:	​ Well, no. But there were robots! I asked one of them questions and it answered me!  

Yaming:	​ Wow! I’d love to go and see them!  

Conversation 2  

Helen:	​ How was your weekend, Teng Fei?  

Teng Fei: ​	It was terrible!  

Helen:	​ Why? What happened?  

Teng Fei: ​	Well, first, I was on my way to meet my friends when some tourists asked me the way to the history museum. I didn’t mean to, but I gave them the wrong directions. I only realized it after they left!  

Helen: Oh no! But don’t worry. They probably asked someone else too.  

Teng Fei: 	​I hope so! But I was so worried. I even got on the wrong bus. ​I was late to meet my friends. Oh, and I left my book on the bus too!  

Helen:	​ Oh no. What a day!  

Section A, 2a and 2d  

Helen:	 ​Hi, Fu Xing. How was your school trip to the wastewater plant? Was it boring?  

Fu Xing : 	No, it wasn’t at all. It was really interesting!  

Helen: ​Wow! What did you see?  

Fu Xing:	​ We saw the plant make dirty water clean again.  

Helen: Really? How?  

Fu Xing:​	 Well, first, dirty water from our homes goes into the plant. Then, special screens remove large pieces of waste from the water.  

Helen: What happens next?  

Fu Xing: 	Well, large machines remove germs and other things from the water. These things are usually too small to see. It takes a few more steps after that before the water becomes clean again.  

Helen: Wow! I used to think it was easy to get clean water.  

Fu Xing:	​ Me too! I didn’t realize it was so hard.  

## Unit 8  Once upon a Time  

### Section A, 1b, 1c, and 1d  

Conversation 1  

Chen Jie:	​ Please share your favourite story with me, Peter.  

Peter:	​ Sure. Once a lion caught a mouse. The mouse was afraid. He said, “Please let me go! One day I will help you!” The lion laughed and let the mouse go. Later, a hunter caught the lion in a net. The mouse helped the lion then. He bit through the net and set the lion free!  

Chen Jie:​	 I like that story. Kindness is never wasted.  

### Conversation 2  

Emma:	​ What’s your favourite story, Teng Fei?  

Teng Fei:	​ Oh, I like this one. A farmer lost his horse. His neighbours said, “How unlucky!” But the farmer just said, “Maybe.” Later, his horse came back with seven other horses. People said, “That’s great!” But the farmer said, “Maybe.” Later, his son broke his leg when he tried to ride a horse. People said, “That’s terrible!” Again, the farmer said, “Maybe.” Well, because of his leg, the son didn’t have to join a war. That saved his life!  

Emma:	​ I see. Unlucky things may turn out well. And good things could go wrong too.  

Teng Fei:​	 Yes, you never know.  

### Section A, 2a and 2e  

Here’s The Emperor’s New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen.  

Once upon a time, an emperor liked clothes very much. He wanted to buy some new clothes.  

Two brothers came and lied to him, “We can make wonderful clothes! But only clever people can see them!” They pretended to make the clothes.  

The emperor’s officials couldn’t see the clothes, but they said, “What lovely clothes!” The emperor couldn’t see anything either, but he said, “They’re beautiful!” No one wanted to look silly.  

The emperor decided to show everyone his new clothes. People in the street praised them. They were afraid to look silly too!  

Suddenly, a boy shouted, “Look! The emperor has no clothes on!” Everyone looked at one another. They started laughing.  

The end! Did you like the story? Please tell me what you think!

## 、朗读基本知识  

### 1. 弱读（Unstressed Words）  

上册书中介绍了英语句子的重音，一般来说，句子中传达重要意义的实词常常重读，重读时，单词的音会发得更高、更长和更响亮。在句子中起粘合作用的助动词、代词、连词、冠词、情态动词等常常会弱读，弱读时，音发得短而快。这些词往往都有自己的弱读音形式（weak form）。例如：  

A: Why do you duj like pandas? B: Because they’re De very cute.  

A: What are you ju doing?  
B: We’re w jogging.  
英语中的助动词和情态动词在句子开头往往弱读，在句子末尾一般重读。例如：A: Did you have a good time last night?B: Yes, I ˈdid.  
A: Are you feeling better?  
B: Yes, I ˈam.  
### 2. 音的同化（Assimilation）  

当两个音相邻时，其中一个音常常受另一个邻音的影响而变成与其邻音相同，或相似，或变成第三个音，这种变音现象叫作音的同化。例如：  

Nice to meet you. $/ \mathrm { m i t } \mathrm { j } \mathrm { u } / \mathrm { \longrightarrow } / \mathrm { m i t } \mathrm { t } \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { J } \mathrm { u } /$   
What would you like to drink, tea or coffee? wd ju $$ wdZu What did you do last night?  dd ju $$ ddZu  

同化现象是英语连贯说话中一种自然的变化，初学者应根据示范朗读体会和模仿学习。  

### 3. 节奏（Rhythm）  

英语是一种节奏较强的语言。英语句子中有的词重读，有的词不重读。英语单词中有重读音节和非重读音节，重读和非重读音节在句中形成一强一弱或一重一轻的变化，这样就形成了英语的节奏。例如：  

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,  

How I wonder what you are.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/26b787b5-8c2d-44a8-9e95-a8f2db3642c5/70694227a44ecb98cda24e5153f9bd75bba57259abe0bcde4fc19eed6e71a804.jpg)  

Up above the world so high,  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/26b787b5-8c2d-44a8-9e95-a8f2db3642c5/2328ec3cce5aec8923e67761949d6e8b26284d782b3597daf22a1143d05ac687.jpg)  

Like a diamond in the sky.  

在上面的歌谣中，每行歌谣有四个重读音节，要读得清楚响亮，重读音节之间夹杂的非重读音节，要读得又轻又快。重弱读音节交替进行，像音乐中的节拍，构成英语句子的节奏。  

# GRAMMAR

## 一、名词（Nouns）  

### 1. 可数名词和不可数名词  

名词按其所表示的事物的性质可分为可数名词和不可数名词。可数名词有单数和复数两种形式，如 an apple—two apples、a bag—some bags 等。不可数名词一般只有一种形式，没有复数形式，如 milk、bread、rice 等。还有一些词既可以充当可数名词，也可以充当不可数名词，如 fruit、fish、chicken 等。  

### 2. 名词复数  

名词的复数形式一般在单数形式后面加 -s 或 -es。名词复数词尾 -s 或 -es 的读音规律一般是：在清辅音后读作/s/，在浊辅音和元音后读作 /z/，在/s/、/z/、//、/tS/、/dZ/等后读作/Iz/。  

名词复数的构成和读音示例如表1 所示。  

表1  名词复数形式的构成和读音  


<html><body><table><tr><td>类别</td><td>构成方法</td><td>例词与读音</td></tr><tr><td>一般情况</td><td>词尾加-s</td><td>book—books/buks/ cap-caps /keps/ job—jobs/d3pbz/ bag-bags /begz/ key—keys /ki:z/ boy—boys /bəiz/</td></tr><tr><td>ch、sh等结 尾的词 以s、x、</td><td>词尾加-es</td><td>class—classes /'kla:siz/ box—boxes /'bpksiz/ watch-watches /'wptfiz/ dish—dishes /'diSiz/</td></tr><tr><td>以辅音字母加 y结尾的词</td><td>变y为i，再 加-es</td><td>family-families /'feməliz/ strawberry—strawberries/'strə:bəriz/ party—parties/'pa:tiz/</td></tr></table></body></html>

注：少数名词的复数形式是不规则的，如 man—men、woman—women、child—children、sheep—sheep 等。  

### 二、形容词（Adjectives）  

形容词可修饰名词或代词，在句子中通常用作定语、表语和补语等。  

1. 用作定语。例如：  

But only clever people can see them!   
It feels like a magical place.   
Those young people like sport very much. 2. 用作表语，置于系动词之后。例如：   
She is busy.   
The film is boring.   
A good student must be diligent.   
They are very hard-working.   
3. 用作补语。例如：   
We need to keep our school clean and tidy. She made me angry last night.  

### 三、副词（Adverbs）  

### 1. 副词的用法和意义  

副词在句中主要用作状语，修饰动词、形容词、其他副词以及全句，表示时间、地点、程度、方式等概念。（1）修饰动词。例如：It’s raining heavily.（2）修饰形容词。例如：The dog is quite cute.（3）修饰其他副词。例如：She drives very carefully.（4）修饰全句。例如：I usually have some bread and milk for breakfast.  

### 2. 频度副词  

频度副词是副词的一种，表示事情发生的频率。常用的频度副词有 always、usually、often、sometimes、seldom (hardly ever)、never 等，它们在频度上的差异为：  

always $>$ usually $>$ often $>$ sometimes $>$ seldom (hardly ever) $>$ never  

频度副词通常放在实义动词前面。如果句子里有情态动词、助动词或系动词 be，频度副词通常放在这类动词之后。例如：  

I always play tennis near my house.   
We usually practise three times a week after school.   
I often go swimming because it keeps me healthy. Sometimes I have eggs and beans.   
I seldom / hardly ever see my friend Lucy now.   
A kind word is never lost.  

## 四、情态动词（Modal Verbs）  

情态动词表示说话人的语气和情态，如请求、许可、意愿、可能等。在形式上，情态动词一般没有人称和数的变化。有的情态动词没有时态的变化，如must。情态动词本身不能单独作谓语，必须和动词原形连用。常见的情态动词有 can、may、must、haveto、should、would 等。情态动词一般有多个意义。情态动词的否定式一般是在其后加not 构成，一般疑问句通常将它提到句首。情态动词的肯定式一般不重读。  

### 1. can 和 could 的用法  

（1）表示能力。例如：   
We can speak a little English.   
I can play badminton, but I can’t play volleyball. He could swim when he was only six.  

（2）表示许可。例如： You can play basketball at the weekend. We can’t run in the hallways. Father said I could swim in the pool.  

（3）表示请求。例如：  
Can you help me with my Chinese?  
could 也可表示请求，但比 can 的语气更委婉。例如：  
Could you tell him to call me back?  

### 2. may 的用法  

（1）表示许可，意思是“可以”。例如：May I borrow your dictionary?Class is over. You may go now.may 和 can 都可以表示许可，但两者略有差别。may 的用法比 can 更正式，语气更委婉。  

（2）表示可能性，意思是“也许；可能”。例如： I may be late, so don’t wait for me.   
That may be true.   
3. must 的用法   
must 表示“必须”。例如： Don’t arrive late for class. We must be on time.   
You must read a book before you watch TV. 4. have to 的用法 have to 表示“不得不；必须”。例如： We have to be quiet in the library. She has to do her homework first when she gets home. have to 表示“必须”时，与must 意义很接近，有时可与must 互换。例如： We have to / must follow the rules. 但它们在以下方面有所不同。 （1）must通常表示的是说话人的主观看法，语气比较强烈，have to 往往强调客观   
需要。例如： We must hurry. I don’t want to miss the beginning of the show. We have to hurry. The train is leaving in five minutes. （2）它们的否定式含义大不相同。mustn’t 表示“不准；禁止”，而don’t have to   
表示“不必”。例如： You mustn’t talk to your mother like that. You don’t have to come if you don’t want to. （3）must没有人称和数的变化，而have to有人称和数的变化。例如： I / We / You / They must do something about it. I have to finish my work today. She has to work late today. They have to get to the station before five o’clock.  

## 五、物主代词（Possessive Pronouns）  

物主代词是表示所有关系的代词，分为形容词性物主代词和名词性物主代词两种。七年级上册已介绍了形容词性物主代词，此处继续介绍名词性物主代词。  

名词性物主代词相当于名词，不能用于名词前，说话时要加重语气。例如：  

A: Is this your pen? B: No, it isn’t. The blue pen is mine.  

A: There is a ping-pong bat here. Is it yours? B: No, it isn’t mine. Is it Ella’s? C: No, hers is at home.

## 六、现在进行时（Present Continuous Tense）  

### 1. 现在进行时的意义  

（1）表示现在（说话时）正在进行的动作或存在的状态。例如：  
The students are listening to the teacher.  
He is sleeping now.（2）也可表示当前一段时间或现阶段正在进行的动作或存在的状态。例如：  
We are working on a farm today.  
I’m reading a history book this month.  

### 2. 现在进行时的构成

## 七、一般过去时（Simple Past Tense）  

### 1. 一般过去时的意义  

（1）表示过去某个时间或某一段时间内发生的动作或存在的状态，常和表示过去的时间状语连用，如 yesterday、last night、in 1990、two days ago 等。例如：

### 3. 动词过去式的构成  

动词过去式的构成分为规则与不规则两类。规则动词过去式一般有四种构成方式，其读音规则一般是：清辅音后面读作/t/，浊辅音和元音后面读作 /d/，/t/ 和 /d/ 后面读作 $/ \mathrm { { r d } / \Omega }$ 。  

表8  动词过去式的构成与读音

还有很多动词的过去式是不规则的，可参见本书附录的不规则动词表。  

## 八、句子种类（Sentence Types）  

英语句子按照用途可分为陈述句、疑问句、祈使句和感叹句四类。七年级上册已经介绍了部分句子种类，此处重点介绍祈使句和疑问句中的选择疑问句的用法。  

### 1. 祈使句（Imperative Sentences）  

祈使句一般用来表示请求、命令、劝说、号召、警告等。祈使句的主语一般是第二人称 you，但往往省略。祈使句的肯定式以动词原形开头，否定式在动词原形前加don’t。例如：  

Just go along this street and turn left.  

Be careful when you cross the street.  

Practise the guitar every day.  

Don’t be late for class.  

Don’t fight.  

Don’t cheat in the exam.  

为表示礼貌，祈使句经常在句首或句末加please。句末用please 时，前面通常加逗号。  

例如：  

Please write and tell me about yourself.  

Please call Karen at 555-8823.  

Come in, please.  

以 let 开头的句子也是祈使句的一种结构，常用于第一人称和第三人称，表示建议、邀请和劝说等。例如：  

Let me tell you the way to my house.   
Let’s see the lions.   
Let him come in.   
Let them play basketball with us.  

2. 选择疑问句（Alternative Questions）  

选择疑问句提供两种或两种以上情况，问对方选择哪一种，选择项用 or 连接。选择疑问句不能用Yes 或No 来回答。朗读时or 前面部分用升调，后面部分用降调。例如：  

A: Is she tall or short?   
B: She’s tall.   
A: Do you usually eat a birthday cake or noodles? B: I usually eat noodles.   
A: What would you like, tea, juice, or coffee? B: I’d like some tea, please.
