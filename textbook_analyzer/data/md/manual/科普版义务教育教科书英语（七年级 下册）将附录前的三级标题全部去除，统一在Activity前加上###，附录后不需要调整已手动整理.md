Making pictures in your mind while reading can help you have a better understanding of what is going on in the text.  

Activity  1 Read the text and use the picture to help you visualize what you read.  

  

On sunny days, water goes up in the air and turns into clouds in the sky.  

### Steps to visualize:

I see in my mind: some water, the sun and some clouds.  

Now, I understand: clouds come from water.  

### Activity  2 Read the text and underline what makes you picture something in your mind.

Do you know the water cycle? Water in the air gets cold, makes clouds and then forms water drops. The drops fall and it rains. Rainwater goes into rivers, lakes and oceans. When it is sunny, water goes up into the sky, forms clouds and then it rains again.  

### Water Cycle

The family don’t have enough water. They seldom plant flowers or grass. They can only take a quick shower once a week. During the shower, they must collect the water. After the shower, they reuse the water. It doesn’t rain much in the desert. Most people get water from the underground, so they have to spend a lot of money digging wells.  

I feel lucky. I don’t need to worry about water, but now I start to save water.   
Join me and let’s make a difference together.

Activity  1 Look at the pictures and read the text. Learn how things develop in the sequence chain.  

  

### Activity  2 Read the text and complete the sequence chain of transportation development.

Activity  3 Pair work. Talk about the development of transportation by following the sequence chain above.  

## Reading Strategies

Step 1: Looking for clues  

The signs stand for different places on the map.  

Step 2: Thinking about what you know  

  

We can find these places on streets.  

Step 3: Making an inference  

It is a street map.  

### Activity  2 Read the text and tick ( $\checkmark 1$ ) the answers.

It was dark, and the wind was strong. I rowed and rowed. Finally, there was an island in front of me. “I’m safe,” I told myself.  

Where was the writer? What was the time of the story? How did the writer get to the island? How did the writer feel in the end?  

On land. At sea.   
In the morning. In the evening.   
By boat. By ship.   
Sad. Happy.  

### Activity  3 Pair work. Complete the table with the clues in the text, and then tell your partner how you make the inferences.

Lastly, members of a team should listen to the ideas and suggestions of other members in the team. This helps build trust in each other. With trust in each other, they can do the teamwork well.  

## Pronunciation Skills 语音技巧

### 1. 单词重音（Word Stress）

英语单词有单音节词、双音节词和多音节词之分。  

由一个音节构成的词叫单音节词。单音节词单独读时都重读，不必标重音符号。例如：  

cup /k7p/ dear /dIr/ have /hæv/ cheap /tip/  

双音节词和多音节词中，其中有一个音节要重读，这个音节就是重读音节。重读音节要读得重而强，一般用重音符号“”标注。例如：  

mother /m7ð9(r)/ different /dIfr9nt / increase /Inkris/  

在有些双音节或多音节词中，有两个重音，一个是主重音，另一个是次重音。主重音用“”表示；次重音用“”表示，标在次重音的左下方。例如：  

afternoon /æft9rnun/ bamboo /bæmbu/ sixteen /sIkstin/  

### 2. 句子重音 （Sentence Stress）

英语中每个单词在单独存在的时候都有重音，但在句子中会发生一定的变化。这个变化就是，并非每个单词在句子中都重读。名词、动词、形容词、副词、数词、指示代词、疑问代词一般重读；人称代词、物主代词、助动词、冠词、介词、连词一般不重读。例如：  

Mike has gone to school.  

She  looks a little tired.  

I usually go to school at seven thirty.  

### 3. 成节音（Syllabic）

英语中一个元音或一个元音前（后）加上一个（或数个）辅音可以构成一个音节。如driver / draIv9(r)/ 包含 /draI/ 和 $/ \mathrm { v } \mathfrak { s } ( \mathfrak { r } ) /$ 两个音节。但较响亮的辅音 $/ 1 / \sqrt { \Omega } \setminus / \mathrm { n } /$ 在没有元音的情况下，与它前面的辅音也可以构成一个音节，这个音节称为成节音。例如：  

table /bl/，little /tl/，camel $/ \mathrm { m l } /$ ，cousin $/ \mathrm { z n } /$ ，seven /vn/  

### 4. 弱读（Weak Form）

一般来说，英语中有些词不重读，主要是系动词、冠词、连词、介词、助动词、情态动  

词、人称代词等。这些词有两种或两种以上读音形式，分别是强读式和弱读式。当读单词时，或者在语句中重读时用强读式，非重读时用弱读式。例如：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>单词</td><td>强读式</td><td>弱读式</td><td>例句</td></tr><tr><td>am</td><td>/aem/</td><td>/əm/;/m/</td><td>I am doing my homework.</td></tr><tr><td>an</td><td>/aen/</td><td>/ən/</td><td>She had an apple.</td></tr><tr><td>but</td><td>/bAt/</td><td>/bat/</td><td>It's tiring,but we are very happy</td></tr><tr><td>for</td><td>/fə:(r)/</td><td>/fa(r)/</td><td>Let's go out for a walk.</td></tr><tr><td>does</td><td>/dAz/</td><td>/dəz/</td><td>What does this mean?</td></tr><tr><td>should them</td><td>/Sud/ /dem/</td><td>/Sed/;/Sd/ /0əm/:/0m/</td><td>What should I do? Alice will tell them the news.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### 5. 爆破 （Plosion）

1）失去爆破  

在单词或语句中，当六个爆破音 /p/、/b/、/t/、/d/、/k/、/G/ 中任意两个相邻或同一个音相邻出现时，第一个爆破音不发生爆破，只做发音的姿势，刚要发出时，立即发出第二个爆破音。这种现象叫失去爆破。例如：  

han(d) bag /hænd bæG/ sui(t) case /sut keIs/ blac(k) coffee /blæk kfi/ shar(p) pencil /rp pensl/  

2）不完全爆破  

当一个爆破音后面紧跟着摩擦音、破擦音、鼻辅音或舌边音时，前面的爆破音只做部分爆破，即刚发出时，立即过渡到第二个音，第一个爆破音声音十分轻微。这种现象叫不完全爆破。例如：  

kee(p) silent / kip saIl9nt/ jus(t) then / dE7st en/ ma(k)e sure / meIk 9(r)/ ol(d) friend /9ld frend/  

### 6. 节奏（Rhythm）

节奏指一个句子中的重音与重音之间的排列模式。通常是重读音节重而慢，非重读音节弱而快；非重读音节越多，读得越快。这种语音起伏轻重、抑扬顿挫的变化现象就是节奏。例如：  

Over and over again.   
She wanted to do it.   
Don’t worry, and she’ll show you how to $\mathrm { ^ { \prime } d o }$ it.  

I must be going. Otherwise I’ll miss the last train.  

### 7. 意群（Sense Group）

意群是句子内部意义相对完整的一个词组或分句。意群的界限是相对的。一个句子可以是一个大意群，也可以按照它的结构和意思分为若干个小意群，用斜线“/”标出。例如：  

1）It is said / practice makes perfect.   
2）By the time of arrival, / he was very tired.  

在说话和朗读时，意群的作用是：如果句子很长，无法一口气说完，可以在意群和意群之间有一个短暂的停顿。正确的停顿应该在意群和意群之间，同一个意群内不应该停顿。例如：  

1）Excuse me, / is this the right way / to the teaching building?   
2）Later that morning, / Mary left her house / and walked to the station / to catch the bus.  

## Words in Each Unit各单元词汇表

注： 星号词为小学阶段已学过的二级词， 黑体词为 《英语课程标准 （2022年版）》 要求初中阶段应学习和掌握的基本词， 白体词为课文中只要求理解的拓展词。

本套教科书根据教育部最新颁布的《义务教育英语课程标准（2022年版）》（以下简称“2022版课标”）编修。  

教科书编修小组由主编、副主编和编辑组成，同时聘请肖思宇、单小明、邓华、邓元、李澧、王若婷、廖芬芳、李艳玲、赖永晖、王培俭、梁晶等二十余人全程参与编修工作。然后，在全国十个省区市对原教科书的使用情况进行调查，广泛收集广大师生用户的意见和建议，深入分析原教科书中有待修订的内容。在此基础上，编修小组制订了详细的工作方案，随即启动了编修工作。  

2022年4月，2022版课标正式颁布。编修小组深入学习课标要求，深刻领会课标精神，重新拟定了编修思路，对原教科书的整体结构、单元编排、素材选编、活动安排、人物形象及插图等进行了全新设计。按新思路编修的教科书具有以下特色：注重核心素养的全面与协同发展，彰显课程的育人价值；以主题为引领对单元进行整体式编排，帮助学生形成单元主题整体概念；践行英语学习活动观，引导学生“在体验中学习，在应用中实践，在迁移中创新”；开展思维和策略的显性教学，强调通过目标明确、内容具体、步骤清晰的显性教学促进学生思维品质和学习能力的发展；注重学生对中外优秀文化的学习，拓宽学生的国际视野，坚定学生的文化自信。  

自初稿定稿到出版发行，本套教科书经过了多轮修改和反复打磨。其间，得到了诸多英语教育专家、教研员和一线教师的指导和帮助，另有数百名教师和学生参与了本套教科书的试教试用。在此，我们谨对他们的宝贵意见和辛劳付出表示衷心感谢！
