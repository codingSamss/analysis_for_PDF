Simon is talking online with his foreign friend, Will, about different types of houses. Work in pairs and talk about your home. Use the conversation below as a model.  

Simon:	 What type of house do you live in, Will?  

Will: I live in a town house in the west of London.  

Simon:	 What’s your favourite place at home?  

Will: I like the study best. There are hundreds of books in the study. It’s relaxing to read books there. What about you?  

Simon:	 I live in a flat in a tall building. I like my bedroom the most. It’s a room of my own. I can put up my favourite pictures on the wall.  

Will: That’s nice.

Unit 1  

  

### Reading

### Homes around the world

  

Simon wants to learn about homes around the world. Here are three blog posts by students from different countries. Before reading, think about the questions below.  

1	 What is your home like?   
2	 What do you like to do at home?  

  

A blog post is an entry (article) that somebody writes on a blog. It can be in the form of text, photos or text with photos. It is usually personal and informal.  

Ni hao! My name is Li Mengtian.  

My family lives in the south of Beijing. Our flat is on the twenty-second floor. It is not big, but we have a nice balcony. I like to look at the nice 5 view of the city there. I often help my parents in the kitchen and share stories about school with them.  

  

Hello! I’m Neil.  

  

I live in a town 15 miles from London. My family 10 and I live in a house with two floors. We love to relax in our living room and chat over a cup of tea. I like the garden best. My brother Tom and I like to water the flowers. We always have fun with our dog there too!  

  

15 Ahlan! I’m Femi.  

I’m from a village near Cairo. There are seven people in my family. We often eat our meals together on a carpet. Next to our farmhouse is a yard. We keep some hens there. My sister and I like to collect the 20 eggs. That’s my favourite part of the day. We also have a cotton field by the Nile River. During the busy season, we children often help in the field.  

  

Complete the chart below with the information in the blog posts.  

  

Read the blog posts again. Write a T if a sentence is true or an F if it is false. Then correct the false one(s).  

1	 Li Mengtian often tells her parents about her school day.  

2	 Neil has a very big family.  

3	 Femi’s family grows cotton near the Nile River.  

4	 Both Neil and Femi have a pet.  

5	 There are more people in Li Mengtian’s family than in Neil’s and Femi’s.  

6	 The three students live in different types of homes, but they all enjoy their lives.  

Unit 1  

C Simon found some pictures in the students’ blog posts. Complete his notes with the correct forms of the words and phrases in the box below.

This is Li Mengtian at her home Beijing. She is enjoying the night on the balcony with her parents. The night looks bright and colourful with fireworks.  

  

It’s the weekend again, the perfect time to have a BBQ in the garden and Neil is helping his parents with the food. them, Tom is playing with their dog. The family are !

Femi lives in a farmhouse in a  

His family keep some hens in the . Femi and his sister are there. Their parents are busy   
in the vegetable field.  

Think about the questions below. Share your answers with your classmates.  

1	 Would you like to live in a small family or a big one? Why?  

2	 How do you usually help your parents at home?  

3	 Can we change the title “Homes around the world” into “Houses around the world”? Why or why not?  

  

### Grammar

### Cardinal numbers

We use cardinal numbers almost every day. Look at the numbers below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>zero</td><td>one</td><td>two</td><td>three</td><td>four</td><td>five</td><td>six</td><td>seven</td><td>eight</td><td>nine</td><td>ten</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td></td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td></td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>eleven</td><td>twelve</td><td>thirteen</td><td>fourteen</td><td></td><td>fifteen</td><td>sixteen</td><td></td><td>seventeen eighteen</td><td></td><td>nineteen</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Read the text below and pay attention to the use of cardinal numbers.  

Neil’s home is about 15 miles from London. It is at 28 Rose Street. It has an area of 160 square metres. His phone number is 0207 000 1111.  

Neil loves taking pictures. He has about 1,000 pictures on his phone. They are very beautiful!  

  

T1u4r1n–t1o42pafogres more about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  

  

We can use cardinal numbers to talk about distance, house numbers, areas, _, years, the number of people and things, etc.  

Try to read the big numbers below.  

$4 , 0 5 6 =$ four thousand and fifty-six $2 3 , 8 1 3 =$ twenty-three thousand, eight hundred and thirteen $5 6 7 , 1 1 0 =$ five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and ten $6 , 4 2 5 , 0 0 0 = { \mathrm { s i } }$ x million, four hundred and twenty-five thousand  

We often use a comma or a space to separate a big number into groups of three from right to left.  

$\textcircled{9}$ Simon is writing about his home and family. Read the sentences below and pay attention to the numbers in his writing.  

1	 We live in Room 806, Building 15, City Garden.   
2	 Our flat is 98 square metres in area.   
3	 Our phone number is 010-1212 1212.   
4	 My sister Annie is nine years old, and she is in Grade 4.   
5	 Mum usually gets up at 6:45 in the morning.   
6	 My computer costs 4,550 yuan.  

Talk with your partner about your home and family, using cardinal numbers.  

Unit 1  

### B Ordinal numbers

Read the sentences below about Li Mengtian and pay attention to the use of ordinal numbers.  

Li Mengtian lives on the twenty-second floor.   
Her birthday is on the twentieth of February.   
She is in the seventh grade.   
She is always the first in her class to get to school.  

• We form most ordinal numbers by adding -th to the cardinal numbers. • If a cardinal number ends in -y, we first change -y into -ie and then add -th to form its ordinal number  

  

We use ordinal numbers to talk about the order of things and events. We use them to talk about grades, dates, positions, etc.  

B1   Simon is doing a test on ordinal numbers. Look at the numbers below and write the numbers out in words.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>1st =</td><td>6th =</td><td>12th= twelfth</td><td>22nd =</td></tr><tr><td>2nd = second</td><td>7th =</td><td>14th =</td><td>30th =</td></tr><tr><td>3rd = third</td><td>8th=</td><td>19th =</td><td>40th = fortieth</td></tr><tr><td>4th = fourth</td><td>9th = ninth</td><td>20th= twentieth</td><td>90th =</td></tr><tr><td>5th = fifth</td><td>10th =</td><td>21st = twenty-first</td><td>100th =</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Simon wants to tell his friends about the three bloggers. Complete his sentences with the correct ordinal numbers.  

1	 Li Mengtian lives in a building with 22 floors. Her home is on the top floor, the floor. Her family always eat yuanxiao on the Lantern Festival—the day of the first month in the Chinese lunar calendar.  

2	 Neil is a Grade 7 student. He is in the grade. He is usually the to get up in his family because he likes jogging in the morning. His mum is the second one, right after Neil.  

3	 Femi’s birthday is in March, the month of the year. Today is his birthday. He is 13 years old now.  

B3   Write a short text about your family life, using both cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers.

### Grammar

### A  Simple future tense with will

Read the conversation below and pay attention to the use of will.  

Amy:	 Mum, I’ll go to the Children’s Centre after lunch.   
Mum:	 OK. But it’ll rain this afternoon.   
Amy:	 Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll take an umbrella with me.  

  

We use will when we talk about:  

  

things that are sure to happen in the future; predictions about (future, past) events; plans that we are making now.  

We ask and answer questions using the simple future tense with will like this:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Will it rain thisafternoon?</td><td>Yes, itwill.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Will you take an umbrella with you?</td><td>No, it won't.</td></tr><tr><td>Yes,Iwill. No,Iwon't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

  

We sometimes use shall with I or we to talk about the future. But this usage is becoming old-fashioned.  

Simon and his sister Annie are talking about the “Let’s clean up” day. Complete their conversation with the simple future tense of the verbs in brackets, using will.  

Simon:	 Hi, Annie. This Saturday is the “Let’s clean $\mathrm { u p ^ { \prime \prime } }$ day. Our neighbours (1) (work) in the community park to make it look nice. Annie: 	 Really? (2) _ you (join) them?

Amy:	 I’m going to be late.   
Simon:	 Oh, don’t worry. Look! The bus is coming!  

We use be going to when we talk about:  

  

things we decide to do;   
• things that will probably happen.  

We ask and answer questions with be going to like this:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Am</td><td>一</td><td rowspan="3">going to</td><td rowspan="3">help</td><td rowspan="3">tomorrow?</td></tr><tr><td>Are</td><td>you/we/they</td></tr><tr><td>Is</td><td>he/she/it</td></tr></table></body></html>

about the future:   
this afternoon   
tonight   
tomorrow   
the day after   
tomorrow   
this Sunday   
next Tuesday   
next week  

When we use be going to without a time expression, we are talking about the near future.

### Pronunciation

### Linking sounds

  

We often link sounds together when we speak English. There are four different ways of linking sounds together.  

1	 We usually link a consonant sound with a vowel sound.  

> an apple stand up in an hour  

2	 When the first word ends in -r or -re and the next word begins with a vowel sound, we can join them together with a $/ \mathrm { r / }$ sound between them.  

  

3	 When two consonant sounds of two words meet, we sometimes do not need to pronounce the first consonant sound.  

4	 When the first word ends with a vowel sound and the next word begins with a vowel sound, we can join them as if there were a $/ \mathrm { j } /$ or $/ \mathrm { w } /$ sound between them.  

A Listen carefully. See how you can link the following words together. Then practise saying them.  

1	 kind and caring 2	 an umbrella 3	 pick up 4	 find out   
5	 volunteer at 6	 litter and mess 7	 here are 8	 there is   
9	 help people 10	 kind doctors 11	 best day 12	 quiet town   
13	 the area 14	 go in 15	 two oranges 16	 three exercises  

B Read the poem below. How do you link the sounds together when you read aloud? Then listen and check.  

### My neighbour

My neighbour is caring and kind.   
She always says hello.   
She talks to me when I’m sad.   
Then I don’t feel so alone. My neighbour is caring and kind.   
She helps anyone in need.   
She makes soup for the old.   
She’s a true friend indeed.

### The art of paper-cutting

1	 What do you know about Chinese paper-cutting?   
2	 Would you like to try paper-cutting? Why or why not?  

In a feature article, it is common to use the present tense to make the description more vivid.  

### Paper-cutting—an art full of life

Zhao Yue’s hands move quickly. She is working on a picture of bamboo. “I love paper-cutting,” she says. “You don’t need much to start working—just a pair of scissors or a knife and some paper. Anyone can try it,” she adds.  

5 After years of practice, Zhao Yue is now a great master of papercutting. Her works on the walls in her home are beautiful. They are in the shape of flowers, birds, fish and landscapes.  

“Paper-cuts are not just beautiful. We use them to express our wishes. At the Spring Festival, we put them up on windows 10 and doors for good luck,” says Zhao Yue. “And at weddings, we put up ‘double happiness’ in the new couple’s home for good wishes.”  

Zhao Yue makes the last cut. She hands me the bamboo picture, smiling, “This is called zhubaoping’an. It means ‘I wish you a  

15 safe and healthy life’.”  The bamboo seems to be alive, and the leaves look like they are dancing. I feel the warmth and life of this traditional folk art.

2	 Which do you like better, paper-cuts of animals and plants, or the ones with Chinese characters? Why?   
3	 Some young people like paper-cutting. Why do you think it is popular with young people?  

  

### Grammar

### A Noun + ’s

Read the text below and pay attention to the use of ’s.  

People often use paper-cuts to celebrate special events like weddings. For example, Zhao Yue’s “double happiness” paper-cuts hang on the windows and walls of her cousin’s home. People often put up this kind of paper-cut in a new couple’s home to bring them happiness and good wishes.  

We usually add ’s or ’ to a noun to express the idea of belonging:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="3">Singular noun</td><td>It is</td><td>Simon's</td><td>lantern.</td></tr><tr><td>That is</td><td>my dad's</td><td>picture.</td></tr><tr><td>This is</td><td>the child's</td><td>kite.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Plural noun</td><td>These are</td><td>my parents'</td><td>pictures.</td></tr><tr><td>Those are</td><td>the children's</td><td>kites.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

We can use “noun + ’s” without a   
following noun, if the meaning is clear. —Whose book is that?   
—Daniel’s.  

  

We often use ’s with names. When a name ends in -s, we can add ’s or ’. James’s picture   Dickens’ novels  

  

• We usually add $( ^ { \prime } , \ { \bf \bar { s } } )$ to a singular noun. • We usually add $\mathbf { ( ^ { \prime } , ~ ^ { \prime } { s } ) }$ to a plural noun ending in -s. • We usually add $\mathbf { ( ^ { \prime } , ~ ^ { \prime } { s } ) }$ to a plural noun that does not end in -s.  

A1   Sandy and Millie are chatting at Millie’s home. Complete their conversation using the words in brackets. Remember to add ’s or ’ where necessary.

Unit 4  

### B Possessive adjectives and pronouns

Read the sentences below and pay attention to the use of possessive adjectives and pronouns.  

I want my classmates to tell me about their favourite traditional crafts.   
A friend of mine is teaching me how to do paper-cutting.   
Millie does woodcarving with her father. His work is amazing. Hers is also good.   
We are making lanterns to decorate our classroom. We use possessive adjectives and pronouns to express the idea of belonging.   
There are different possessive adjectives and pronouns for each pronoun. We use possessive adjectives (before, after) nouns.   
We (use, don’t use) nouns after possessive pronouns.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Possessive adjective</td><td colspan="3">Possessive pronoun</td></tr><tr><td></td><td rowspan="4">love</td><td>my</td><td rowspan="9">picture.</td><td rowspan="9">It is</td><td>mine.</td></tr><tr><td>Yu</td><td>yur</td><td>yurs.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>They</td><td>their</td><td>theirs.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">He</td><td rowspan="2">loves</td><td>his</td><td>his.</td></tr><tr><td>her</td><td>hers.</td></tr><tr><td>She It</td><td>its</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

B2 Write at least five sentences about the handicrafts you and your friends have, using possessive adjectives and pronouns, and “noun $\mathbf { \nabla } + \mathbf { \nabla } \mathbf { \bar { s } } ^ { \prime \prime }$ .  

### Pronunciation

### Stress in sentences

When we speak English, we often stress important words, e.g. nouns, main verbs, adjectives and adverbs. We do not usually stress less important words, e.g. articles, prepositions, pronouns or conjunctions.  

Zhao Yue is working on a picture of bamboo. It means “I wish you a safe and healthy life”.  

However, the words are not equally important. We can stress some of these words to show that they are more important information.  

Zhao Yue smiles when she finishes a beautiful picture of bamboo. (Zhao Yue smiles. It’s not somebody else.)   
Zhao Yue smiles when she finishes a beautiful picture of bamboo. (She does not look sad.)   
Zhao Yue smiles when she finishes a beautiful picture of bamboo. (The picture is beautiful, not ugly.)   
Zhao Yue smiles when she finishes a beautiful picture of bamboo. (It is a picture of bamboo, not any other thing.)  

Listen to the following conversation. Pay attention to the stressed words.  

Sandy:	 Where are you going, Millie?   
Millie:	 I’m going to the supermarket.   
Sandy:	 What are you going to buy?   
Millie:	 My scissors are broken. I’m going to buy a new pair. Sandy:	 I need some pens. Can I go with you?   
Millie:	 Of course.  

B Read the sentences aloud. Stress different words in each sentence according to the meanings given below it.  

1	 I want to buy some paper at the craft shop. a	 I am talking about a craft shop, not another kind of shop. b	 I am talking about some paper, not something else. c	 I am talking about what I want to do, not what I do not want to do.  

2	 Sandy paints pictures on Saturday afternoons.  

a	 I am talking about Sandy, not somebody else.   
b	 I am talking about painting pictures, not another activity.   
c	 I am talking about Saturday afternoons, not other afternoons.

My dog is the cleverest animal of all.

10 My dog is my very best friend, And I’ll look after him till the end.  

  

When reading a poem, we need to pay attention to the tone, rhyme, rhythm and structure as they play a role in shaping the overall meaning.  

My cat  

My cat has soft fur, And loves to purr. 15 She can jump really high, Way up into the sky.  

  

She has a pair of blue eyes, And likes to run after butterflies. Sometimes she climbs a tall tree, 20 But never forgets to come back to me.  

When I’m lonely, she’s always there. She can’t talk, but does care. When I need a friend or feel sad, She is always by my side.

B   Suzy found an article about how humans get design ideas from some animals. Read the article and answer the questions below.  

### Animals and design

Humans have a lot to thank animals for. For example, we get design ideas from animals to help us make new things.  

Radar allows ships to “see” things around them and travel safely. The idea comes from bats. Bats make sounds, and then listen for the echo. This echo tells the bats about things around them.  

  

  

Then there are planes. Humans looked at birds and studied their wings. Then they had the idea of planes. Planes have a pair of big wings, just like birds.  

1	 What can radar help ships do?   
2 	 What other things did people make by studying animals?  

C The Class 1, Grade 7 students are talking about the relationship between people and animals. Work in pairs and talk about the topic. Use the conversation below as a model.  

Mr Wu:	 Do you think it’s good for us to be friends with animals?  

Daniel:	 Yes. Lots of animals are very friendly. They cheer us up when we feel sad.  

Suzy: I agree. And I think people can also learn from animals. For example, ants are hard-working, and they often work as a team.  

Millie: True. Also, some animals can be very useful, like dogs. They’re smart and can even help people save lives.  

Mr Wu:	 That’s correct. Animals and humans have a special relationship, and we should respect and care for them.  

D Mr Wu asked the Class 1, Grade 7 students to give a presentation about an animal friend for the Pet Week.

Unit 6  

  

### Reading

### Four main landscapes

  

Daniel is reading an article about landscapes in a geography magazine. Here is the article.   
Before reading, think about the questions below.  

  

1	 What landscapes on earth do you know about?   
2	 What do you think the earth would say if it could talk?  

Personification is to give human qualities to non-human things like objects, animals and ideas. It helps make the writing more vivid and interesting. It also helps draw readers’ attention.  

### Hello from different landscapes

  

I am a river. I have two faces. I give life: my water is fresh water, so everybody can drink it and use it for farming and washing. But I am also very powerful. When I flood, I sometimes destroy homes and lives. Nothing can get in my way.  

I am a desert. My body is mostly made of sand and I seldom see rain. I am very hot during the day and very cold at night. Nobody wants to live 10 in such difficult conditions, but a few plants and animals can survive. How amazing!  

  

15  

  

I am the ocean. I am huge. I cover more than two-thirds of the earth’s surface, so people call the earth the “Blue Planet”. What a beautiful name! I am home to hundreds of thousands of living things.  

I am a forest. I am full of trees, and I produce oxygen for humans and animals to breathe. I wear different colours in different seasons, 20 usually green in summer and golden brown in autumn.

Think about the questions below. Share your answers with your classmates.  

1	 Which of the four landscapes in the article would you like to visit most? Why?  

2	 What can we get from knowing more about different landscapes on earth?  

3	 How can we get along well with nature?  

  

### Grammar

### A Using indefinite pronouns

Read the table below and pay attention to the use of indefinite pronouns.  

When we are offering something or when we expect the answer to be “yes”, we can use somebody/ someone/something in questions. e.g. Would you like something to drink?  

<html><body><table><tr><td>somebody/someone/ something</td><td>Look! There's somebody/someone on the mountain! There seems to be something in the river.</td></tr><tr><td>anybody/anyone/ anything</td><td>I can't see anybody/anyone/anything up the mountain. Does anybody/anyone want to visit the desert? Can you see anything in the river?</td></tr><tr><td>everybody/everyone/ everything</td><td>Is everybody/everyone going to the forest? Everything is ready for our trip to the forest.</td></tr><tr><td>nobody/no one/ nothing</td><td>There is nobody/no one up the mountain. There is nothing in the river.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

  

We use indefinite pronouns to refer to people and things when we do not know or do not need to mention who or what we are talking about. We use pronouns ending in -body or -one for and pronouns ending in -thing for  

A1 Mr Wu is asking the students to describe a picture. Look at the picture and complete the sentences with the correct indefinite pronouns.  

Millie:	 Look! There’s (1) sitting by the campfire. There isn’t (2) else with him. He may be lonely.  

Sandy:	 Yes. (3) is camping with him. He’s alone. Not (4) likes camping, but the man seems to enjoy it.  

Simon:	 I can see a fire, but the man isn’t cooking (5) . It looks like there’s (6) to eat.  

Daniel:	 There’s (7) inside his tent: it looks like a light. The tent looks warm. I think he has got (8) ready for a good night’s sleep.  

  

A2   Find a picture of a landscape with people in it and talk with your partner about it, using indefinite pronouns.  

Unit 6  

### B Using what and how to express strong feelings

Read the conversation below about Huanglong in Sichuan and pay attention to the use of what and how.  

Sandy:	 Look at this photo of Huanglong. What a beautiful view!  

Daniel:	 Yes. How amazing!  

  

We use what and how in sentences to express strong feelings about someone or something. We make these sentences like this:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="4">What</td><td>a high mountain</td><td>(it is)!</td><td rowspan="4">How</td><td>high</td><td>(the mountain is)!</td></tr><tr><td>beautiful forests</td><td>(they are)!</td><td>beautiful</td><td>(the forests are)!</td></tr><tr><td>wonderful landscapes</td><td>(the earth has)!</td><td>wonderful</td><td>(the earth's landscapes are)!</td></tr><tr><td>a huge ocean</td><td>(it is)!</td><td>huge</td><td>(the ocean is)!</td></tr></table></body></html>  

To make a sentence to express strong feelings:  

  

we use a(n) (noun phrase, adjective) after what;   
we use a(n) (noun phrase, adjective) after how.  

B1   Mr Wu is talking to Daniel about the Songhua River. Complete their conversation with what and how.  

Mr Wu:	 The Songhua River runs through Heilongjiang and Jilin and it’s about 2,300 kilometres long.  

Daniel:	 Wow! (1) a long river!  

Mr Wu:	 The land along the Songhua River is very good for growing corn. There are many large farms there.  

Daniel: (2) useful! The farmers must love the river.  

Mr Wu:	 Yes. The landscape along the river is very beautiful.  

Daniel: (3) wonderful! What’s the best way to see the Songhua Rive  

Mr Wu:	 Just take a boat trip, and you can enjoy the nice views along the river.  

Daniel: (4) interesting! I love learning about new places.  

Mr Wu:	 I’ll ask each student to talk about their favourite landscape next week.  

Daniel: (5) a good idea! That will be really fun!  

B2 Find a picture of a landscape without people in it and talk about it with your classmates, using what and how to express your feelings about it.  

### Pronunciation

### Intonation

  

Intonation describes the falls and rises of the voice in speech. There are two main types of intonation in English: falling intonation and rising intonation.  

When we speak, our tone falls at the end of a statement.  

1	 There are some plants in the desert. 2	 The mountains are very tall.  

When we ask a yes-no question, our tone rises at the end of the question.  

1	 Is the forest far away? 2	 Are there any rivers in the forest?  

When we ask a wh-question, our tone usually falls at the end of the question. 1	 What animals live in the ocean? 2	 How can we go across the river?  

We make our tone rise at the end of a phrase or a sentence to show surprise.  

Amy: I visited the Tianshan Mountains during this summer holiday.  

Daniel:	 You visited the Tianshan Mountains? They’re so far away.  

In alternative questions with or, our tone rises on the first part of the question and falls on the second part.   
Is it a hill or a mountain?  

$\textcircled{6}$ Read the conversation below. Put a falling arrow $\widehat { ( ~ \ " ~ } )$ or a rising arrow (   ) at the end of each sentence. Then practise it with your partner.  

Sandy:	 Hi, Millie. Tomorrow is Sunday. Would you like to go for a walk?  

Millie:	 Yes, I’d like to. The weather is perfect for walking at this time of year. Where do you want to go?   
Sandy:	 Let’s go to Sunshine Forest Park.   
Millie:	 Sunshine Forest Park? I love it there. The air is really fresh with many trees and flowers around.   
Sandy:	 Yes. And we can ride a bike through the forests.   
Millie:	 Great! When shall we meet? Is 10 in the morning OK?   
Sandy:	 Yes, that’s good. See you then.

Yesterday I went on a cycling trip with my friends. It was an amazing experience!  

After breakfast, we set off for a little village. We followed the map on 5 my phone, but it did not give enough details about the countryside. We got lost! None of us knew the right way. I was a little worried, but luckily, a driver stopped and told us which way to go.  

We cycled for another hour and then arrived at the village. We were all excited. The village is in a beautiful and quiet area. After lunch, 10 we walked around and saw all kinds of interesting flowers and plants. I used an app to find out more about them. We took some great photos. It was really enjoyable!  

On our way back, Sandy’s bike had a problem. Daniel took out his tools. We all helped repair Sandy’s bike. We were a little tired,  

15 but we were proud of our teamwork.  

It was a great day! We had a lot of fun and learnt about nature. I can’t wait 20 to do it again.

### Grammar

### Simple past tense

Read the short text below and pay attention to the use of verbs in bold.  

  

Last term, I tried roller skating for the first time. At first, I could not even stand up on my skates. My skating teacher is really nice. He helped me practise, and little by little, I found it very enjoyable. Now I'm not so afraid of skating. I'm going to have my skating lesson at the weekend. I can't wait.  

  

We often use these time expressions when we talk about the day before yesterday yesterday morning/ afternoon/evening last night/week/ month/year  

Last term, Millie began to learn roller skating.  

Millie went roller skating last week.  

  

We use the simple past tense to talk about things that (are happening now, happened in the past).  

Verbs ending in a vowel + y form the simple past tense by adding -ed. stay $$ stayed  

We form the simple past tense like this:  

Turn to pages 130–131 for more irregular verbs.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Most verbs</td><td>+ed</td><td>walk ） walked</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Verbs ending in -e</td><td>+ d</td><td>love） loved</td><td rowspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td>Verbs ending in a consonant + y</td><td>-y+ ied</td><td>try）tried</td></tr><tr><td>Short verbs ending in a vowel + a consonant</td><td>double the consonant + ed</td><td>stop） stopped</td></tr></table></body></html>  

We form the simple past tense of irregular verbs differently. We do not add -ed.  

### Unit 7

Amy is writing about her family’s camping trip last weekend. Complete her sentences below, using the simple past tense.  

1	 My family (plan) a camping trip with my aunt’s family last week.

6	 We (meet) my aunt’s family on the way.  

7	 They (take) their pet dog with them.  

8	 It (be) a great experience, and all of us (have) lots of fun.  

Amy is telling Simon about her family’s camping trip. Complete their conversation with the simple past tense of the verbs in brackets.  

Amy: I went camping for the first time last weekend. We (1) (walk) around the lake, and we also (2) (go) fishing in the lake. We (3) (have) so much fun.

Simon:	 How lovely! I can’t wait to do it too.  

  

C Amy is writing about her camping trip last weekend. Complete her writing with the simple past tense of the verbs in brackets.  

Last weekend, I went camping with my family. We (1) (stay) at a campsite near a lake. The view in that area (2) (be) beautiful. We (3) (sleep) in a tent at night. Shirley and I (4) (be) a little afraid of the dark at first. Dad (5) (tell) some interesting stories about his childhood. And I was much more relaxed. Then I (6) (go) to sleep to the sound of nature.  

D Write a short text about one of your outdoor activities, using the simple past tense.  

### Pronunciation

### The -ed ending

  

Many verbs in the simple past tense end in the letters -ed. There are three different ways of pronouncing this ending: $/ \mathrm { t } / , / \mathrm { d } /$ and $/ \mathrm { I d } /$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>/t/</td><td>/d/</td><td></td><td>/1d/</td></tr><tr><td>looked</td><td></td><td>answered</td><td>started</td></tr><tr><td> jumped</td><td></td><td>opened</td><td>ended</td></tr><tr><td> stopped</td><td></td><td>tried</td><td>needed</td></tr><tr><td>watched</td><td></td><td>played</td><td>hated</td></tr></table></body></html>  

How do you pronounce the endings of the words below? Listen carefully and write /t/, d/ or /Id/ in the blanks.  

1 listened 2	 visited 3	 shopped   
4	 liked 5	 chatted 6	 picked   
7 smiled 8	 showed 9 walked   
10	 hoped 11	 missed 12	 turned  

B Read the text below and try to pronounce the -ed endings of verbs in the simple past tense. Then listen and check if you are right.  

Last weekend, I climbed a mountain with my classmates. We also invited our form teacher to go with us. At about 8 o’clock, we arrived at the foot of the mountain. Then we started climbing. We walked along paths and steps up to the top. When we reached the halfway point up the mountain, we were very tired. We stopped for a short while and then went on. It took us about three hours to get to the top. The view from the top was fantastic! I was very tired when I came back home, but it was worth it.

Do you ever feel like you can’t focus on your work? Or do you feel a little down sometimes? Well, why not take a break and go camping? The fresh air and camping activities can be good for your body and mind.  

Camping is such a great activity: put up a tent, roll out your sleeping bag and then fall asleep under the stars. It will give you a chance to take a break from your busy life. You don’t need to worry about anything. Just relax and enjoy nature.

Mr Wu:	 Remember to take binoculars. They’ll help you see the birds more clearly.  

Simon:	 OK. Do you have any other useful tips?  

Mr Wu:	 You’d better wear comfortable shoes and take some water. People usually go birdwatching for hours. You may walk a long way and get thirsty.  

Simon:	 All right. Anything else?  

Mr Wu:	 Don’t stay out after it gets dark.  

  

Simon:	 OK. Thanks, Mr Wu.

### Down the rabbit hole

One sunny day, Alice and her sister sat by a river. Then Alice heard a sound. She looked up and saw a white rabbit in a coat passing by.  

“Oh dear! I’ll be late!” said the rabbit. It took a 5 watch out of its pocket and looked at the time.  

  

How amazing! Alice stood up and ran across the field after the rabbit. The rabbit jumped down a big hole. Alice did not want to let the rabbit get away, so she jumped down the hole too.  

10 Down, down, down. Alice fell for a long time, and then she hit the ground. She found herself alone in a long, low hall. There were doors all around, but they were all locked. Alice saw a small key on a table, but it did not fit any of the locks.  

  

Then Alice noticed a small door and put 15 the key into the lock. The door opened! She could see a lovely garden on the other side. Alice tried to go through the door, but she was too big.

### Pronunciation

### Sense groups

  

When we read a sentence, we often pause in the middle. Usually, these pauses are made according to the grammatical structure of the sentence.  

Grammatically, a sentence is made up of several parts and each has its own meaning. These parts are called sense groups.  

A sense group can be a word, a phrase (noun phrase, verb phrase and prepositional phrase, etc.) or a clause. We often use the slash sign $( / )$ to separate different sense groups in a sentence.  

I/like reading/after I finish my homework.   
After school,/my friends and I/went to different clubs.  

Read the sentences below and mark pauses (/) where you think they are necessary. Listen and check your answers.  

1	 Journey to the West is one of my favourites.   
2	 I like the Monkey King best. He is very clever.   
3	 This book makes me want to try new things.   
4	 I also want to travel and have exciting experiences in the future.   
5	 I enjoy reading fantasy books because I find them really exciting.  

Read the following text aloud. Add pauses (/) in the right places. Listen and check.  

I tried an audiobook last weekend. I played the book on my phone. I listened for over two hours and did not want to stop. I enjoyed it because the story is really exciting. Also, I could do other things at the same time. I tidied my bedroom while I listened.

### Integration

### Fantastic fantasy

  

Sandy is reading an article about fantasy stories. Read the article and answer the estions below.  

### A guide to fantasy

### What is fantasy?

In a fantasy book, the story isn’t set in the real world. It often takes place in another world and at a different time. Good fantasy stories take us on exciting adventures in worlds full of magic. They let us travel to new lands and meet fantastic characters.  

### Why is fantasy so popular?

Fantasy stories allow us to enjoy an imagined world and take a break from our everyday lives. While we are reading the stories, we forget our worries and relax.  

1	 What are the features of fantasy stories?   
2	 What fantasy stories have you read? Did you enjoy them? Why or why not?  

Sandy is listening to a recommendation of Five Children and It. Listen to it and complete Sandy’s notes.  

Name: Five Children and It  

Writer: E. Nesbit, a (1) writer  

Plot:

### What we can learn:

We should be (5) what we wish for. Something may seem like a good idea at first but can bring about big problems later.

Simon:	 But then his walking stick becomes a peach forest. It’s fantastic.  

Sandy:	 I think so. What’s your favourite story?  

Simon:	 I like “Jingwei Filling the Sea”. She works so hard and never gives up in the face of difficult tasks.  

Sandy:	 Yes. That story teaches us a good lesson for life: never give up on our goals.
