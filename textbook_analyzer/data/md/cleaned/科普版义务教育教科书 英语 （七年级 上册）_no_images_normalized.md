### 前 言

亲爱的同学们：  

你们好！  

本套教科书根据我国《义务教育英语课程标准（2022年版）》编写，旨在帮助你们通过英语课程的学习，逐步形成核心素养，在提高英语语言能力的同时，领略中外优秀文化，养成良好思想品德，发展终身学习能力。  

本套教科书分为六册，共三十三个单元。每个单元围绕一个主题，先由开篇页导入，再分四个板块从不同侧面展开学习。  

开篇页为一幅精美的主题插图，图上附有单元序号和标题、一个主题之问，以及语言交际、文化学习、思维训练、策略运用和项目实践五个方面的学习目标。这些图文可以帮助你们了解单元主题、明确学习目标，激发你们对单元主题的学习兴趣。  

开篇页之后是“准备”板块。该板块包括听说（Listening & Speaking）、功能（Function）和语音（Pronunciation）三个部分，主要通过听、说、看、读等活动引入单元主题，帮助你们掌握与主题相关的语言和文化基础知识，激发你们进一步探索单元主题的兴趣。  

接下来是“探索”板块。该板块包括思维技能（Thinking Skills）、阅读策略（Reading Strategies）、主题阅读（Theme Reading）和语法应用（Grammar inUse）四个部分。思维技能和阅读策略以专项训练的方式进行，并在主题阅读活动中复现。主题阅读通过一个语篇和多个紧密相连的活动引导你们从语言、文化、思维、策略等不同视角对单元主题进行探索。语法应用分为词法和句法应用，帮助你们在梳理语法规则的同时，进一步对单元主题进行探索。  

之后是“拓展”板块。该板块包括口头交际（Oral Communication）和以读促写（Reading for Writing）两个部分，分别以口头产出和笔头产出为目的，采取先听后讨论、先读后仿写的形式，帮助你们围绕单元主题进行拓展学习。  

最后是“收篇”板块。该板块包括项目实践（Project）、复习（Review）和自评（Self-assessment）三个部分。项目实践强调使用语言做事情，要求你们使用英语并通过动手做来完成一项小组合作实践项目。复习部分重点复习单元的词汇和语法，同时通过听说和阅读活动补充或升华单元的主题学习。自评部分以主观题和客观题相结合的方式，帮助你们对单元主题学习、核心素养达成、活动参与情况、学习计划等进行回顾和反思。

### Pronunciation Skills 语音技巧

### 1. 音素 （Phoneme）

音素是最小的语音单位。英语音素有元音和辅音两种，共有 48 个音素，其中元音 20 个，辅音28 个。  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Vowels</td><td colspan="2">/i:/ /1/ /e/ /ae/ /31/ // /A/ /5/ /p/ /u:/ /u/ /a:/</td></tr><tr><td>/a1/ /e1/ /au/ /au/ /51/ /12/</td><td>/eə/ /uə/</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Consonants</td><td>/p/ /b/ /t/ /d/ /k/ /g/</td></tr><tr><td>/v/ /0/ /0/ /s/ /z/ /S/ 13/ /r/ /h/</td></tr><tr><td>/f/ /ts/ /dz/ /tr/ /dr/ /tf/ /d3/</td></tr><tr><td>/m/ /n/ //</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>/ /w/</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### 2. 音节（Syllable）

音节由音素组成。元音是构成音节的主体，英语中一个音节可以只由一个元音构成，如/aI/；也可以由一个元音和若干个辅音构成，如/mi/、/æm/ 和/teIk/ 等。  

一般来说，一个元音可以构成一个音节，但较响亮的辅音 $/ 1 / \sqrt { \phantom { } } , / \mathrm { m / \Omega } , / \mathrm { n / \Omega }$ 在后面没有元音时，与它前面的辅音也可以构成一个音节，称为成节音，如apple 中的 $/ \mathrm { p l } /$ 和 lesson 中的 $/ \mathrm { s n } /$ 。  

音节有开音节和闭音节之分。开音节是以发音的元音字母结尾的重读音节，如no、she；或是以“元音字母 $^ +$ 辅音字母（r 除外） $^ +$ 不发音的e”结尾的重读音节，如name、like。闭音节指的是以辅音字母结尾的重读音节（r 除外）。  

五个元音字母在开音节和闭音节中的发音如下表所示：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>元音字母</td><td>Aa</td><td>Ee</td><td>Ii</td><td>00</td><td colspan="2">Uu</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">开音节</td><td>/e1/</td><td>/i:</td><td>/a1/</td><td>/əu/</td><td colspan="2">/ju/</td></tr><tr><td>face</td><td>she</td><td>hi</td><td>hello</td><td colspan="2">duty</td></tr><tr><td>name</td><td>these</td><td>like</td><td>hope</td><td colspan="2">cute</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">闭音节</td><td>/e/</td><td>/e/</td><td>/1/</td><td>//</td><td>/N</td><td>/u/</td></tr><tr><td>map</td><td>desk</td><td>is</td><td>box</td><td>bus</td><td>put</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### 3. 连读 （Liaison）

在同一个意群中，前一个单词末尾的音和后一个单词词首的音有时可连起来读，这种现象称为连读。连读现象是在语言交际中，随着语速的加快而自然产生的，可用符号“ ”表示。常见的连读情况有：  

1）辅音 $^ +$ 元音  

如果前一个词以辅音结尾，后一个词以元音开头，这两个词可以连读。例如：  

Take a look at it.  

2）r/re $^ +$ 元音  

如果前一个词的词尾是 r 或者 re，后一个词以元音开头，这两个词可以连读，中间增加一个 $/ \mathrm { r } / $ 音。例如：  

There is a tree over there.  

3）元音 $^ +$ 元音  

如果前一个词以元音结尾，后一个也以元音开头，这两个词可以连读，中间增加一个很短的过渡音/j/ 或者/w/。例如：  

Please do it.  

He asked for a glass of water.  

### 4. 语调（Intonation）

在说话或朗读时声调的抑扬叫作语调。英语的基本语调分为“降调”和“升调”两种，主要表现为语句末尾语调的降和升，分别用语调符号 （降调）或 （升调）来表示。  

1）降调  

$\textcircled{1}$ 陈述句：I am a student. $\textcircled{2}$ 特殊疑问句：What are you doing? $\textcircled{3}$ 祈使句：Take it. $\textcircled{4}$ 感叹句：What a lovely day!  

2）升调  

$\textcircled{1}$ 一般疑问句：Are you from America?  
$\textcircled{2}$ 选择疑问句的前一部分：Would you like coffee or tea?  
$\textcircled{3}$ 表示列举或命名的句子中的前一部分：Let’s count: one, two, three, four, and five.

### 后记

本套教科书根据教育部最新颁布的《义务教育英语课程标准（2022年版）》（以下简称“2022版课标”）编修。  

教科书编修小组由主编、副主编和编辑组成，同时聘请肖思宇、单小明、邓华、邓元、李澧、王若婷、廖芬芳、李艳玲、赖永晖、王培俭、梁晶等二十余人全程参与编修工作。然后,在全国十个省区市对原教科书的使用情况进行调查，广泛收集广大师生用户的意见和建议，深入分析原教科书中有待修订的内容。在此基础上，编修小组制订了详细的工作方案，随即启动了编修工作。  

2022年4月，2022版课标正式颁布。编修小组深入学习课标要求，深刻领会课标精神，重新拟定了编修思路，对原教科书的整体结构、单元编排、素材选编、活动安排、人物形象及插图等进行了全新设计。按新思路编修的教科书具有以下特色：注重核心素养的全面与协同发展，彰显课程的育人价值；以主题为引领对单元进行整体式编排，帮助学生形成单元主题整体概念；践行英语学习活动观，引导学生“在体验中学习，在应用中实践，在迁移中创新”；开展思维和策略的显性教学，强调通过目标明确、内容具体、步骤清晰的显性教学促进学生思维品质和学习能力的发展；注重学生对中外优秀文化的学习，拓宽学生的国际视野，坚定学生的文化自信。  

自初稿定稿到出版发行，本套教科书经过了多轮修改和反复打磨。其间，得到了诸多英语教育专家、教研员和一线教师的指导和帮助，另有数百名教师和学生参与了本套教科书的试教试用。在此，我们谨对他们的宝贵意见和辛劳付出表示衷心感谢！  

教科书使用过程中，如有任何意见和建议，欢迎随时联系我们。
