Let us remember: one book, one pen, one child and one teacher can change the world.  

Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself.  

Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.  

The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.  

There are many famous quotes and sayings about learning. Find more and discuss them with your classmates.

### B  Make

  

1	 Film your video   
• Check the lighting around you. Don’t film if it is too dark.   
Hold the camera and point it at what you want to film. Hold it still to get a clear video.   
• Speak clearly and loudly so the audience can hear.   
• Film your video in short parts. This will make it easy to start again if you make a mistake.  

2	 Edit your video  

  

• Choose the best bits of what you have filmed and put them all together. • Make sure your video is the right length. • Choose a piece of music to add to the video. Lively music will make it more interesting for your audience. But don’t make the music too loud.

### Grammar

### Countable and uncountable nouns

A countable noun refers to something we can count. Here are some examples.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Countable nouns (singular)</td><td colspan="3">Countable nouns (plural)</td></tr><tr><td>an apple</td><td>a carrot</td><td>a cake</td><td>two apples</td><td> six carrots</td><td>ten cakes</td></tr></table></body></html>  

We use a or an before a singular countable noun. If the noun starts with a vowel sound, we use an.  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">I want to eat</td><td>a</td><td>banana. cake.</td><td rowspan="2">TIP More examles a unit</td></tr><tr><td>an</td><td>orange. egg.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

To form the plural of most countable nouns, we add -s to the singular form.   
However, there are some exceptions.  

Turn to page 144 for changes in pronunciation.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Most nouns</td><td>+S</td><td>cake</td><td>cakes</td></tr><tr><td>Nouns ending in a consonant + y</td><td>-y+ies</td><td>story</td><td>stories buses</td></tr><tr><td>Nouns ending in s, sh, ch or x</td><td>+es</td><td>bus wish match box → →</td><td>wishes matches boxes</td></tr><tr><td>Nouns ending in o</td><td>+sor+es</td><td>photo potato tomato</td><td>photos potatoes tomatoes</td></tr><tr><td>Nouns ending in f or fe</td><td>- f/fe + ves</td><td>half life</td><td>halves lives</td></tr><tr><td>Some other nouns</td><td></td><td>man woman foot tooth → child sheep →</td><td>men women feet teeth children sheep</td></tr></table></body></html>

### Choosing the right colour

Sunshine Middle School invited Ms Li, a fashion designer, to advise students on choosing the right colour to wear. Here is the interview script. Before reading, think about the questions below.  

1	 Do you think colour matching is important? Why or why not?   
2	 What questions about colours do you have for a fashion designer?  

Kitty:	 Good morning, Ms Li. May I ask you some questions about colours in fashion?  

P tWexe mwiatyh bthetetehrelupndofe swtoarnds laike such as, for example or in fact.  

Ms Li:  	Sure.  

Kitty:	 How can we choose the right colours to wear? Could you give us some 5 advice? Ms Li:	 Well, it depends on the colour of our skin. Some people look good in warm colours, like yellow, red and orange, but other people look nice in cool colours, such as green, blue and purple. Kitty: 	 Which colours go well together? 10 Ms Li:  	Try to pick similar colours. For example, wear dark blue jeans with a light blue blouse or T-shirt. Kitty:  	OK, but can we mix warm and cool colours? Ms Li:	 Yes. In fact, warm and cool colours make each other stand out, such as yellow and green or orange and blue. But don’t wear more than three 15 colours at one time.  

Kitty:	 What colours match all?  

Ms Li:	 Black, white and grey go well with any colour. They’re suitable for both formal suits and casual 20 clothes.  

Kitty:  	 Thanks for your advice, Ms Li.  

  

  
Kitty is making some notes about Ms Li’s talk. Complete her notes below.  

Read the interview script again. Write a T if a sentence is true or an F if it is false. Then correct the false one(s).  

1	 Ms Li knows a lot about colours in fashion.   
2	 Both orange and green are warm colours.

### Grammar

### Asking questions

Read the conversations below. Pay attention to the three question types.  

Daniel:	 Do you have a talk with Ms Li before the show? Kitty: Yes. It’s about colours in fashion.   
Daniel:	 Is Ms Li a teacher?   
Kitty: No. She’s a fashion designer.  

When we answer a question with yes or no, we call it a yes-no question.  

Daniel:	 When is the fashion show, by the way? Kitty: It’s on Friday afternoon. Daniel:	 Where does the show take place? Kitty: In the school hall.  

  

A wh-question begins with a question word. We need more information to answer a wh-question.  

Daniel:	 Is your favourite colour a warm colour or a cool colour? Kitty:	 My favourite colour is yellow. It’s a warm colour. Daniel:	 Which colours do you like to wear, warm colours or cool ones? Kitty:	 I look better in warm colours like red, yellow and orange.  

A question with  gives two or more choices. We need to choose one in order to answer it.  

  

• To make a yes-no question, we often put the verb ,  or can (before, after) the subject.   
• To ask a wh-question, we use a wh-word (at the start, in the middle, at the end) of the sentence. We ask a question with  by giving (two, two or more) choices.  

Millie is showing Andy some pictures of her Art class. Andy is asking her some questions. Complete the questions with the correct wh-words.  

1 is the woman in brown? She’s our Art teacher.   
2 painting is on the wall? It’s Sandy’s.

### My fashion design

Look at the model. Here is my design for a shirt, a jacket, a pair of jeans and a pair of sports shoes.  

The shirt is white. I think white shirts have a clean look, and white matches any other colour.  

The jacket is not too long or too large, and it is dark blue. Students look smart in dark blue.  

  

Jeans are very popular with students, so my design has a pair of blue jeans.  

The shirt, the jacket and the jeans are all made of cotton and are very comfortable.  

There is also a pair of sports shoes. They are grey and made of leather. Sports shoes are light and good for sport, and all the students like them.  

All of these come in different sizes. Do you like my design?  

Write an article about your fashion design. Make a writing plan like the one in Part D1. Use Sandy’s article as a model.

We use “Lovely!” as a response when we want to show we are happy about what someone said or did, similar to “That’s nice/ great!”  

Will: That sounds like a lot of fun too! I’d love to spend the Spring Festival in China one day.  

The students in Class 1, Grade 7 are writing about their favourite festivals.  

Here is Simon’s writing plan. Read it below.  

  

Unit 8  

  

Read Simon’s article about his favourite festival.  

### The Spring Festival

  

  

My favourite festival is the Spring Festival. It is an important holiday in China. It is always in January or February.  

Usually, people clean their homes and put up the Spring Festival couplets beforehand. On the Chinese New Year’s Eve, families get together and enjoy a big dinner. We prepare some dishes with special meanings, like jiaozi and niangao. Then people like to watch the Spring Festival Gala on TV. During the holiday, people visit relatives and friends and send each other good wishes. Elders often give kids red packets to wish them good luck.  

The Spring Festival lasts till the Lantern Festival. It is often cold at this time of year, but people feel warm in their hearts.  

D3   Write about your favourite festival. Make a writing plan like the one in Part D1. Use Simon’s article as a model.  

### Useful expressions

注意：  在非正式文体中，is/are 与not 可以缩写。如：is n $\mathrm { o t } = \mathrm { i } \mathrm { s n ^ { \prime } t }$ 、are no $\mathfrak { t } = \mathrm { a r } \mathfrak { t }$ en’t。am 与 not 不能缩写。动词be 一般现在时的一般疑问句式是将be 提前至句首。如：  
—Are you good at Maths? 你擅长数学吗？  
—Yes, I am. 是的，我擅长。  
—Is that girl your classmate? 那个女孩是你的同学吗？  
—No, she isn’t. 不，她不是。  
注意：  在肯定答句中，主语和动词be 不能缩写，如：“Yes, he is.”不能缩写为“Yes,he’s.”。  

### Unit 2

### 一般现在时(II)

我们常用一般现在时谈论我们经常做的事、不受时间限制的客观事实以及人或物的一般特征。这时我们常使用行为动词，这种动词有具体、实际的含义。请比较：  

My hobby is painting. 我的爱好是绘画。（动词 be） I love painting. 我热爱绘画。（行为动词）  

注意： 当我们用一般现在时进行表达的时候，不能同时使用动词be 和行为动词。如：I am good at swimming.（✓）I love swimming.（✓）I am love swimming.（✗）  

行为动词的一般现在时可用于以下情况：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>用法</td><td>例句</td></tr><tr><td>经常性、习惯性的行为</td><td>I often go to the Art Club after school.</td></tr><tr><td>不受时间限制的客观事实</td><td>Fish live in water.</td></tr><tr><td>人或物的一般特征</td><td>She sings very well.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

根据主语的人称和数的不同，行为动词的一般现在时有两种形式。  
当主语是第一人称的单复数、第二人称的单复数和第三人称复数时，行为动词使用其原形。如：  
We have different subjects at school. 在学校我们有不同的科目。  
They enjoy jogging in their free time. 他们有空的时候喜欢慢跑。  
当主语是第三人称单数时，行为动词使用其第三人称单数形式。如：  
She visits museums every weekend. 她每个周末都去参观博物馆。  
He plays football every day. 他每天踢足球。  

行为动词一般现在时的第三人称单数形式的构成方法如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>规则</td><td>举例</td><td>读音变化</td></tr><tr><td>大多数动词后加 S</td><td>make-makes live-lives</td><td>清辅音后的s读/s/,浊辅音或元音后 的s读/z/</td></tr><tr><td>以“辅音字母+y”结尾 的动词,去掉y,再加ies</td><td>carry-carries cry—cries</td><td>es读/z/ 注意：如果动词以“元音字母+y”结 尾,不适用此规则。如：play一 plays</td></tr><tr><td>以ch、sh、ss或x结尾 的动词后加es</td><td>teach—teaches finish—finishes guess-guesses fix—fixes</td><td>es读/1z/</td></tr><tr><td>以“辅音字母+0”结尾 的动词后加es</td><td>go-goes</td><td>es读/z/</td></tr><tr><td>特殊变化</td><td>have-has</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

行为动词一般现在时的否定句式是在行为动词前加do not 或does not。当主语是第三人称单数时，助动词用 does。在非正式文体中，do not 和 does not 可以缩写成 don’t和 doesn’t。如：  

Students do not go to school on Sunday. 学生周日不上学。   
$\mathbf { \Sigma } = \mathbf { \Sigma }$ Students don’t go to school on Sunday.   
He does not work in this shop. 他不在这家商店工作。   
$\mathbf { \Sigma } = \mathbf { \Sigma }$ He doesn’t work in this shop.  

行为动词一般现在时的疑问句式是在句首加助动词do 或does。当主语是第三人称单数时，助动词用does。如：  

—Do you like traditional Chinese painting? 你喜欢国画吗？  
—Yes, I do. I like landscape painting best. 是的，我喜欢。我最喜欢山水画。—Does John often play basketball after school? 约翰放学后经常打篮球吗？—No, he doesn’t. 不，他不常打。  
注意： 在疑问句和否定句中，助动词之后的行为动词均用原形。  
要注意区分行为动词do 和助动词do 的用法。如：  
I do not do housework on Saturday. 我周六不做家务。  
Do you do housework on Saturday? 你周六做家务吗？  
在上面每个例句中，第一个do 是助动词，第二个do 是行为动词。  

### Unit 3

### 人称代词

我们常用人称代词来代替表示人或物的名词。如： Lucy and I are in the library. We like reading here.   
我和露西在图书馆里。我们喜欢在这里读书。   
Look at these classrooms. They are clean and bright.   
看看这些教室。它们整洁又明亮。   
The panda is cute. Everyone likes it. 这只熊猫很可爱。大家都喜欢它。   
Helen is my classmate. I often play with her. 海伦是我的同学。我常和她一起玩。   
注意： 人称代词不仅可以指代人，还可以指代动植物及无生命的物体。   
如果人称代词在句子中作主语，用主格；如果人称代词作宾语，用宾格。主格常位于句首， 宾格一般在动词或介词之后。  

人称代词的主格和宾格归纳如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">人称代词</td><td colspan="4">单数</td><td colspan="3">复数</td></tr><tr><td>第一人称</td><td>第二人称</td><td></td><td>第三人称</td><td>第一人称</td><td>第二人称</td><td>第三人称</td></tr><tr><td>主格</td><td>I</td><td> you</td><td>he</td><td>she</td><td>it</td><td>we</td><td>you</td><td>they</td></tr><tr><td>宾格</td><td>me</td><td> you</td><td>him</td><td>her</td><td>it</td><td>us</td><td> you</td><td>them</td></tr></table></body></html>  

注意：  第一人称单数主格I 始终要大写；第二人称单、复数的主格和宾格形式相同，均为you；第三人称单数主格有he、she 和it，对应的宾格分别为him、her 和it。  

### Unit 4

### 表示时间的介词 (in/on/at)

我们可以使用in、on 或at 来构成表示时间的短语。  

<html><body><table><tr><td>介词</td><td>用于</td><td>举例</td></tr><tr><td>in</td><td>上午、下午、晚上 月份 季节 年份</td><td>in the morning/afternoon/evening in January/February/March/April/May/June/July/ August/September/October/November/December in spring/summer/autumn/winter in 2008/2022/2100</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>星期 日期 某一天的上午、下午、晚上 特定的节日 (一天)</td><td>on Sunday/Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/ Thursday/Friday/Saturday on1 September on a cold morning/Sunday afternoon on Children's Day</td></tr><tr><td>at</td><td>某一时刻 年龄</td><td>at 4:15 at 12 (years old)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

注意：  如果节日不止一天，而是持续一段时间，我们用at。如：at Christmas、at theSpring Festival。  

### 频度副词

我们可以使用频度副词来表示做某件事的频率。如：He always takes a walk after dinner. 他总是晚饭后去散步。  
They are never late for school. 他们上学从不迟到。  
Many Chinese people often pay with mobile phones now.  
现在很多中国人经常用手机支付。  

注意：  频度副词一般放在行为动词的前面、助动词do/does 和动词be 的后面。频度副词所表示的频率由低到高为：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>never 从不</td><td>seldom 很少</td><td>sometimes 有时</td><td>often 经常</td><td>usually 通常</td><td>always 总是</td></tr><tr><td>0%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>>100%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### Unit 5

### 可数名词和不可数名词

英语中的名词按其表示的事物的性质可分为可数名词与不可数名词。  

可数名词，顾名思义，是可以用数目来计算的人或物。指一个人或一件事物时，用单数形式；指两个及以上的人或事物时，用复数形式。如：  
I usually have a sandwich for breakfast. 我早餐通常吃一个三明治。  
They exercise in different ways. 他们用不同的方式锻炼身体。  
单数的可数名词或名词短语前一般有限定词，如：冠词a/an、the，指示代词this、that，形容词性物主代词 my、your、his、her、their，名词所有格 John’s 等。  
注意：  冠词a 用于辅音音素开头的可数名词前；an 用于元音音素开头的可数名词前，  

而不是元音字母开头的名词前。如：There is an apple tree in the garden. 花园里有一棵苹果树。Mary dances for an hour every day. 玛丽每天跳一个小时的舞。She has an umbrella and a useful book. 她有一把雨伞和一本有用的书。  

单数可数名词变成复数形式的常见规则如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>规则</td><td>举例</td><td>备注</td></tr><tr><td>大多数词后加 S</td><td>book-books egg-eggs day-days</td><td>清辅音后的s读/s/,浊辅音或元音后的s读 /z/</td></tr><tr><td>以“辅音字母+ y”结尾的词,去 掉y,再加ies</td><td>hobby-hobbies library-libraries activity—activities</td><td>es读/z/ 注意：此处是“辅音字母+y”,而“元音字母 + y”则不适用此规则。如：boy—boys</td></tr><tr><td>以 s、sh、ch、x 结尾的词后加 es</td><td>glass-glasses dish—dishes bench-benches box—boxes</td><td>es读/Iz/ 注意：以ch结尾但不发/tS/的可数名词不适 用此规则。如：stomach—stomachs</td></tr><tr><td>以0结尾的词 后有的加 s,有 的加es</td><td>piano—pianos ZO0—ZOos hero—heroes</td><td>s读/z/,es读/z/</td></tr><tr><td>以 f/fe结尾的 词,去掉f/fe,再 加ves</td><td>shelf-shelves leaf-leaves knife-knives</td><td>ves读 /vz/</td></tr><tr><td>特殊变化</td><td>man-men foot-feet child-children fish—fish</td><td>由 man或woman与另一可数名词组成的复 合名词变为复数时，两部分都发生变化。 如：womendrivers女司机 men doctors 男医生</td></tr></table></body></html>  

不可数名词指不可以计数的名词。不可数名词无单、复数之分，前面有无限定词均可。如：The soup smells great. 汤闻起来很香。  

Do you have salt? 你有盐吗？  

不可数名词前不能用a/an 或表示具体数量的数词，但可以用the 或表示数量多少的some、much、a little、little、a lot of 等词或短语修饰。如：  
a lot of water 许多水  a little milk 一点牛奶  
不可数名词前还可以用表示量的“可数名词 $^ +$ of”短语来表示数量。如：  
a piece of paper 一张纸  three cups of coffee 三杯咖啡  
five kilos of beef 五千克牛肉  
如果主语是不可数名词，谓语动词常用单数。如：  
Coffee is a kind of drink. 咖啡是一种饮品。  
英语中常见的不可数名词有time（时间）、money（钱）、work（工作，劳动）、homework（家庭作业）、news（消息）、luck（运气）等。  

### Unit 6

### 疑问句

### 一般疑问句

用yes 或no 作答的疑问句叫一般疑问句。一般疑问句以be 动词、情态动词或助动词开头，回答通常比较简短。如：  

—Is the shirt made of cotton? 这件衬衫是棉质的吗？—No. It’s made of wool. 不是，是羊毛的。  
—Can I try them on? 我可以试穿吗？  
—Yes, of course. 是的，当然可以。  
—Do you like this blue T-shirt? 你喜欢这件蓝色 T 恤吗？—Yes, I do. 是的，我喜欢。  
一般疑问句主要有如下特点：  

用 yes 或 no 作答（有时根据语气的不同，yes 也可以由 sure、certainly、of course 等词代替，no 可由 sorry 代替）。  
答语中的主语须与问句的主语一致（但必须用主格代词）。如果问句中主语是this/that，回答时用it 代替；如果问句中主语是these/those，回答时用they 代替。  
沿用问句中的引导词（be 动词、情态动词或助动词）。  

### 特殊疑问句

我们使用特殊疑问句询问一些具体信息。如：  
What is your favourite colour? 你最喜欢什么颜色？  
Whose shoes are these? 这些是谁的鞋子？  
特殊疑问句以疑问词开头，常用的疑问词有 what、who、whose、when、where、which、why、how 等。因大多数疑问词以wh- 开头，故特殊疑问句又被称为“wh- 问句”。  

常见的疑问词的用法如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">疑问词</td><td>含义</td><td>例句</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">what</td><td>什么</td><td>What is your name/job?</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">what</td><td>class/ grade</td><td>哪个班级/年级</td><td>What class/grade are you in?</td></tr><tr><td>colour</td><td>什么颜色</td><td>What colour is your new jacket?</td></tr><tr><td>time</td><td>几点</td><td>What time does the show start?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">when</td><td>什么时候</td><td>When is your birthday party?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">where</td><td>哪里</td><td>Where do they live?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">who</td><td>谁</td><td>Who is the man in a blue sweater?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">why</td><td>为什么</td><td>Why do many people like hanfu?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">whose</td><td>谁的</td><td>Whose design is your favourite?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">which</td><td>哪一个</td><td>Which T-shirt matches this skirt?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">how</td><td>怎么样</td><td>How do we go to the museum?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="7">how</td><td>many much</td><td>多少 (可数) 多少 (不可数)</td><td>How many students are there in your class? How much milk do you drink every day?</td></tr><tr><td>old</td><td>几岁/多少岁</td><td>Howold is your Art teacher?</td></tr><tr><td>often</td><td>多长时间一次</td><td>How often do you go to the library?</td></tr><tr><td>long</td><td>多长 多久</td><td>How long is the Yangtze River?</td></tr><tr><td>far</td><td>多远</td><td>How long do you watch TV every day? How far is your home from school?</td></tr><tr><td> tall</td><td>多高</td><td>How tall is the girl over there?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

注意：  1. 特殊疑问句不能用yes 或no 回答，而要针对问题回答，即问什么答什么。如：—How is the girl these days? 这个女孩最近怎么样？—She is fine. 她挺好的。 $( \checkmark )$ ） —Yes. 好的。（✗）  

2.  针对疑问词what time 的回答多为具体时间，而针对when 的回答可以是大概时间，也可以是具体时间。如：—What time does the fashion show start? 时装表演几点开始？—At seven o’clock. 七点。—When do you watch the fashion show? 你什么时候看时装表演？—On Wednesday afternoon. 周三下午。  

3. 疑问词 whose、which 后可以跟名词。如：Whose shirt is this? 这是谁的衬衫？Which scarf do you like? 你喜欢哪条围巾？  
4. 当对价格或金额提问时，用how much。如：How much is your T-shirt? 你的 T 恤多少钱？  

### 选择疑问句

当我们想要为对方提供两种或更多情况以便其从中选择一种时，通常使用选择疑问句。选择疑问句不能用yes 或no 回答，回答者必须从备选项中选择其一，可以作简略回答。选择疑问句可由一般疑问句组成。如：  
—Do you like silk scarves or cotton scarves? 你喜欢丝质的围巾还是棉质的围巾？—Silk. 丝质的。  
选择疑问句也可由特殊疑问句组成。如：  
—Which dress do you like, this one or that one? 你喜欢哪条裙子，这条还是那条？—I like this one. 我喜欢这条。  

### Unit 7

### 用 some 和 any 表示数量

我们可以用some 和any 这样表示不定数或不定量的词来修饰名词。some 和any 表示“一些”，可修饰可数名词，也可修饰不可数名词。如：There are some gifts on the desk. 桌上有一些礼物。I want to buy some food. 我想买一些食物。  

There are not any oranges in the shop. 商店里没有柑橘了。Do you have any free time? 你有空吗？some 常用于肯定句中，any 常用于否定句或疑问句中。如：He has some new notebooks. 他有一些新笔记本。He does not have any new notebooks. 他没有新笔记本。Does he have any new notebooks? 他有新笔记本吗？  

注意：  我们提出建议或请求时常用some，表示希望得到对方的肯定答复。如：  

Would you like some drink? 你想喝点饮料吗？   
—Can you tell me some Chinese idiom stories? 你能给我讲一些中国成语故事吗？   
—Sure. How about the story of Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya? 当然。管鲍之交 的故事怎么样？  

### there be 结构

我们常常会用there be 结构来表达“某地有某物或某人”。如：  

There is a shopping mall near the bank. 银行附近有一个商场。  

There are a lot of friends at my birthday party. 我生日会上来了很多朋友。  

There is not any water in her glass. 她的杯子里没有水了。  

Are there any girl students in the team? 队里有女学生吗？  

there be 结构中，动词be 的单复数形式与其后的名词一致。其后的名词如果是可数名词单数或不可数名词，动词be 用单数形式；其后的名词如果是可数名词复数，动词be 用复数形式。  

注意：  当there be 后面有两个或两个以上的名词时，动词be 的单复数形式要与离它最近的名词一致，即“邻近原则”。如：There is a girl and two boys in the classroom. 教室里有一个女生和两个男生。There are two boys and a girl in the classroom. 教室里有两个男生和一个女生。  

there be 结构的否定句式是在动词be 后加not；一般疑问句式是把动词be 提前至句首，应答时可以说“Yes, there is/are.”或“No, there is/are not.”。  
要注意区分there be和have的用法。there be结构表示“存在”，而have表示“拥有”。如：There is a picture on the wall. 墙上有幅画。  
I have some pictures. 我有一些画。  

### Unit 8

### 现在进行时

我们用现在进行时表示正在进行的动作或状态。如：  
I am chatting with the elders. 我正和长辈们聊天。  
My grandfather is walking around the park. 我爷爷正在公园散步。  
现在进行时可以表示说话时正在进行或发生的动作，也可表示当前一段时间内的活动或现阶段正在进行的动作。如：  
We are waiting for you here. 我们正在这儿等你呢。Tom is making a card for his mum all the afternoon.  
汤姆整个下午都在给妈妈做贺卡。  
We are celebrating New Year this week. 这一周我们都在欢庆新年。  
如果句子带有鲜明的时间状语，如now，或带有look 和listen 等暗示词，或有表示现在的上下文语境，我们常用现在进行时。如：  
My mum is cooking dinner now. 我妈妈正在做饭。  
Listen! Our teacher is singing a song. 听！我们的老师正在唱歌。  
—Where is your father? 你爸爸在哪儿？  
—Oh, he is cleaning his car. 噢，他正在洗车。  
注意：有些动词一般不用于现在进行时，如 know、understand、love、like、want、hear、see 等。  

现在进行时的基本结构是“主语 $^ +$ be $^ +$ 动词的现在分词”。现在分词的构成规则如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>规则</td><td>举例</td></tr><tr><td>大多数动词后加ing</td><td>go-going</td></tr><tr><td>以不发音的e结尾的动词,去掉e,再加ing</td><td>take-taking</td></tr><tr><td>以ie结尾的动词,变ie为y,再加ing</td><td>die-dying</td></tr><tr><td>以一个辅音字母结尾的重读闭音节动词,双写最后一 个辅音字母，再加ing</td><td>get-getting swim-swimming</td></tr></table></body></html>  

注意：  重读闭音节首先必须是重读音节，同时这个音节是以辅音音素结尾。  
现在进行时的否定句式是“主语 $+ { \mathrm { ~ b e ~ } } + { \mathrm { n o t ~ } } +$ 动词的现在分词”结构。如：  
The students are not having lunch. 学生们不在吃午餐。  
现在进行时的一般疑问句式是把be 提前至句首。如：  
—Is that girl listening to music now? 那个女孩正在听音乐吗？  
—Yes, she is. 是的，她在。  
现在进行时的特殊疑问句式是“疑问词 $+ \mathrm { b e } +$ 主语 $^ +$ 动词的现在分词”结构。如：—What are you reading? 你在看什么书？  
—I’m reading a book about Chinese tea culture. 我在看一本有关中国茶文化的书。
