2000 年，外语教学与研究出版社依据国家《义务教育英语课程标准（实验稿）》组织开发了本套教材。至今，本套教材已出版使用二十余年，得到了广大师生的一致好评。2022 年，以马克思主义中国化时代化最新成果为指引，根据教育部《义务教育英语课程标准（2022 年版）》的理念与要求，在充分考虑我国义务教育阶段英语教育实际学情和教情的基础上，我们对本套教材进行了认真修订，重建了框架结构且进行了全新的内容设计，确保在初中英语学科教育中全面贯彻党的教育方针，落实立德树人根本任务。  

修订后的初中教材共 6 册，每册均由 6 个学习单元及附录组成，七年级上册增设了小初衔接单元（Starter）。教材各学习单元均遵循认知发展过程编写，分为“理解—发展—实践”三个环节，由 5 个板块构成，分别为：背景激活（Starting out）、主题理解（Understanding ideas）、 思 维 拓 展（Developing ideas）、 主 题 实 践（Presenting ideas）、自我评价（Reflection）。附录包括 Communication bank、Language notes、Words andexpressions 等板块。  

修订后的教材的主要特色如下：  

一、科学设计单元流程，整体设计单元内容，秉持在体验中学习、在实践中运用、在迁移中创新的学习理念，切实落实学思结合、用创为本的英语学习活动观。  

二、语篇题材多样、体裁丰富，语言地道鲜活、难度适中，符合学生的兴趣特点，有助于提升学生的语篇意识、丰富学生的语言感知与学习体验。  

三、活动设计紧密围绕主题，指向主题意义建构与产出，促使学生发现问题、分析问题和解决问题。  

四、坚持“教—学—评”一体化，围绕教材各环节的学习过程和成果，将评价贯穿于英语课程教与学的全过程，彰显评价的促学和促教作用。  

五、融通多元文化，促进文明互鉴。引导学生在增强国家认同的基础上，尊重世界文化多样性，开展灵活、有效、坚守中国立场的跨文化沟通，提升文化自信。  

学习英语没有捷径，需要持之以恒的努力。本套教材旨在帮助广大学生以开放的心态接受新挑战，积极尝试，大胆实践。通过不断学习，提升核心素养，为继续学习英语和终身发展打下坚实的基础。

carries his father across a   
cold river. It brings back the   
father’s memory of carrying   
the son on his back. Tears   
quietly run down his face.

Day 1   
21 Sep 2023  

We’re studying birds for Bird Week at school. Some lucky kids got penguins. But I have to write about… pigeons! $\circledast$  

Day 2 I’m watching pigeons in the park now. They just knock 22 Sep 2023 around – for the whole morning! They leave droppings here and there. Pigeons are BORING and DIRTY!  

A girl is feeding them. Argh! The birds are flying madly to her. They’re SCARY!  

  

Day 3 I’m doing some online research. Pigeons can recognise 23 Sep 2023 themselves in mirrors. How surprising! Are they so clever? I’d better go and watch them again…  

### Day 4

24 Sep 2023  

I’m back at the park again. Oh! That pigeon is looking at itself in the water! Maybe I was wrong about pigeons.  

  

Day 5 I’m reading in the library now. Oh, there are over 200 kinds of 25 Sep 2023 pigeons. Some can fly several thousand kilometres and don’t get lost. They can also fly at speeds of over $1 0 0 \mathrm { k m }$ per hour. That’s as fast as my dad’s car!  

Well, pigeons aren’t boring or scary. They are AMAZING – I just didn’t know enough about them!

### Language notes

### Unit 1

### 1.	 Learning without thinking is of no use. 学而不思则罔。

本句出自儒家经典著作《论语》，意在提醒人们要把学习和思考结合起来，才能真正学到知识。《论语》由孔门弟子及再传弟子汇集孔子言行而成。孔子（前551 — 前479）名丘，字仲尼，我国春秋末期思想家、政治家、教育家，儒家创始人。相传弟子有三千，贤者七十余。《诗》《书》《礼》《乐》《春秋》等典籍皆经其整理编订。被后世尊称为“圣人”，立为“万世师表”。  

### 2.	 Please write this down.

### 请把这句话抄下来。

write down意为“写下，（在纸上）记下”，表示把一些信息、数据或事实写下来以便能记住。例如：  
She wrote down his number on the paper. 她在纸上写下了他的号码。  

### 3.	 But is it OK to point out the mistake? 但是指出错误合适吗？

point out意为“指出，指明”。例如：  
He points out my mistakes in the homework. 他指出了我作业中的错误。  

### 4.	 Mencius

### 孟子

孟子（约前372 — 前289）名轲，字子舆，战国时期思想家。孟子是孔子之孙的再传弟子，被尊称为“亚圣”，后人常将其与孔子并称为“孔孟”。所传《孟子》一书，既是研究其思想、生平的重要资料，亦具较高文学价值。  

5.	 In fact, this is my first lesson for all of you.其实，这是我想给你们所有人上的第一堂课。  

本句使用了双关的修辞手法。从字面意思来看，first lesson指学生们在初中开学上的第一堂课。同时，first lesson也象征着学生们在初中学习到的第一个重要道理：学习不仅仅是被动地接受信息，还需要主动思考和质疑，在学习中，批判性思维和独立思考是非常重要的。这个道理超越了简单的课堂知识，所以称之为first lesson。  

6.	 Primary school was like a pool. It was small and safe. Dad and Mum protected your boat from winds. 小学就像一个水池，小而安全。爸爸和妈妈保护着你的小船， 使其免受风吹。  

(1) pool通常指一个装满水的小池子，句中用来比喻小学。wind被用来表示可能遇到的困难或挑战。  
(2) protect… from…是固定搭配，意为“保护…… 避免…… ”。例如：We should protect the city from destruction. 我们应当保护这座城市免受破坏。  

7.	 But sometimes you have to sail your boat by yourself.但有时候你必须独自驾驶你的小船。by oneself意为“独自地”，通常用来描述一个人独立完成某件事。例如：She made the cake by herself. 她自己做了蛋糕。  

8.	 You will go through storms towards the sea.你将会穿过风暴，驶向大海。句中through意为“穿过，经过”，表示与位置相关的概念，指经过某一地区或从一组物体中穿过。例如：We passed through France on our way to Italy. 我们去意大利时途经法国。  

### 9.	 With love致以爱意的

(1) 本文中有一封书信，With love 是书信的落款，常常出现在给亲人或亲密朋友的信件中。英文中其他常见的落款表达包括 Yours sincerely（诚挚地），Best regards（谨致问候），Kind regards（亲切的问候），Yours faithfully（忠诚地）等。选用哪个主要取决于信件的正式程度以及收信人与发信人的关系。  

(2) 请注意，在书写时，落款的首字母需大写，末尾需使用逗号。  

### Unit 2

### Unit 1

### 人称代词和物主代词

### 1. 人称代词

### (1) 主格与宾格的区分

人称代词在句中作主语时用主格形式，作宾语和表语时一般用宾格形式。例如：  

They told us to get ready at once. 他们让我们马上准备好。 He bought very nice birthday presents for you and me. 他给 你和我买了非常好的生日礼物。   
-Who is it? 是谁？   
-It’s me. 是我。  

另外，宾格代词（特别是 me）可以作主语。主格代词一般不单独使用，也不用于带not的简短回答中，这些情况下往往用宾格代词。  

例如：  

-Who wants a ride on my bike? 谁想骑我的自行车？-Me! / Not me! 我！ / 我不想！  

### ( 2 ) it 的用法

it 除用来指代人和事物外，还可以用来表示时间、天气、距离等。  

例如：  

It’s 12 o’clock now. 现在是 12 点。   
It’s a fine day today. 今天天气不错。   
It’s 20 km from here.（那儿）离这儿 20 公里。  

### (3) 人称代词的顺序

当多个人称代词并用时，英语中人称代词的排列顺序与汉语不同。汉语中喜欢说“你、我、 他╱她”，而英语中通常要说 you, he /she and I，复数人称代词的排列顺序是 we, you and they。  

### 2. 物主代词

物主代词可以分为形容词性物主代词和名词性物主代词。它们有什么区别呢？让我们来看一下。  

(1) 形容词性物主代词起形容词的作用，用在名词前。例如：  

Is this your football? 这是你的足球吗？Are my crayons there too? 我的蜡笔也在那里吗？  

(2) 名词性物主代词起名词的作用。为了避免重复使用名词，我们经常用名词性物主代词来代替“形容词性物主代词 $^ +$ 名词”的形式。例如：Look at the two pencils. The red one is yours $\overset { \prime } { \underset { \mathrm { i } } { = } }$ your pencil)and the blue one is mine $\left( = \right.$ my pencil). 看这两支铅笔。红的是你的，蓝的是我的。  

让我们再来看一些例句：  

May I use your pen? Yours works better. 我可以用一下你的钢笔吗？你的更好用。  

Is this your book or mine? 这本书是你的还是我的？最后让我们一起总结一下英语中的物主代词：  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2">人称</td><td colspan="2">物主代词</td></tr><tr><td>形容词性</td><td>名词性</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">第一人称</td><td>单数：我的</td><td>my</td><td>mine</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">复数：我们的</td><td>our</td><td>ours</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">第二人称</td><td colspan="2">单数：你的</td><td>your</td><td>yours</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">复数：你们的</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">第三人称</td><td rowspan="2">单数</td><td>他的</td><td>his</td><td>his</td></tr><tr><td>她的 它的</td><td>her</td><td>hers</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">复数：他们的/她们的/它们的</td><td>its their</td><td>its theirs</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

### Unit 2

### there be 句型的用法

如果要表达“……地方有……”该用什么句型呢？一般应采用 there be句 型。  

试看下面的例子：  

There is an apple on the desk. 桌子上有个苹果。  

There are many students in the playground. 操场上有很多学生。  

There is still some water in the cup. 杯子里还有一些水。从以上句子可以看出，there be 句型的结构一般为“there is / are $^ +$ 某物/某人 $^ +$ 地点”，表示某地方有某物，也可以表示某地方有某人。如果要表达某地没有某物或某人，或者询问什么地方是否有某物或某人时，就要用到 there be 句型的否定和疑问形式。在 there be 句型中，从句法结构上讲 there 为主语，所以其疑问形式是将 be 提至 there 之前，构成 isthere / are there 的句式，而否定形式是在 be 后面加 not（可以缩写）。  

<html><body><table><tr><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td><td>疑问句</td><td>回答</td></tr><tr><td>There is a computer on the</td><td>There isn't a Is there a</td><td></td><td>Yes, there is.</td></tr><tr><td>food on the table.</td><td>There isn't any</td><td>Is there any food</td><td>Yes, there is.</td></tr><tr><td>playground.</td><td>students in the</td><td>students in the playground?</td><td>Yes, there are. No, there aren't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

可以看出，there be 句型的变化形式与系动词 be 的变化形式相似，只是要注意 be 的形式变化一般视其后面名词的单复数而定。  

注意：there is / are 用于表示现在某个地方有某物或某人时，所表示的物或人都是泛指，而非特指。例如：  

There is some water in the bottle. 瓶子里有些水。   
There are many students in the classroom. 教室里有很多学生。  

### Unit 3

### 名词的所有格

名词的所有格一般采用名词后加 ’s 的形式，如 a child’s dream, someone’sbag；以-s结尾的复数名词的所有格直接加 ’ 即可，如 the boys’ schoolbags。所有格表示的是所属关系，采用 ’s 结构的多为有生命的名词。如果是无生命的名词，多采用“of $^ +$ 名词”的结构表达。例如：  

the window of the house 房子的窗户the end of the year 年末the gate of our school 我们学校的大门注意，a friend of my father’s 与 my father’s friend 的含义不同，前者含有“我父亲有不止一个朋友”的意思，而后者没有这一含义。  

### Unit 4

### 频度副词

在英文中用来表示动作频率的词被称为“频度副词”。常见的频度副词包括：always, usually, often, sometimes, never等。这些频度副词所代表的频率大小，可参考下图：  

### Guide to the language use

<html><body><table><tr><td>频度副词的比较</td></tr><tr><td>always 总是 100%</td></tr><tr><td>usually 通常 80%-90%</td></tr><tr><td>often 经常 50%-70%</td></tr><tr><td>sometimes 有时 20%-40%</td></tr><tr><td>never 从不 0%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

在句子中，频度副词一般位于系动词、助动词、情态动词之后，或行为动词之前。  

1) 在系动词之后。例如：She is usually very busy. 她通常很忙。  
2) 在助动词之后。例如：I will never forget this holiday. 我永远不会忘记这个假期。  
3)  在情态动词之后。例如：You should always go to school on time. 你应该总是按时上学。  
4) 在行为动词之前。例如：We often go to the cinema. 我们经常去电影院看电影。  

sometimes可放在句首、句中或句末，often也可放在句末。例如：Sometimes she calls me. / She calls me sometimes. 她有时候给我打电话。She calls me often. 她经常给我打电话。  

如果句子中有两个助动词，频度副词通常放在第一个助动词后面。   
例如：   
We have never been given the chance to talk to him. 我们从未得到过与 他对话的机会。  

### 一般现在时

### 1. be 动词的一般现在时

如果有人问你的年龄、身份或者现在的身体状况，你会怎么说呢？你可以说：  

I am 12 years old. 我 12 岁了。   
I am a student. 我是一名学生。   
I am very well. 我身体很好。  

这几句谈论的都是现在的状态，可以用 be 动词的一般现在时表达。注意系动词 be 的形式随主语的不同而有所变化。变化形式为：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>一</td><td>am</td></tr><tr><td>He / She / It</td><td>is</td></tr><tr><td>We / You / They</td><td>are</td></tr></table></body></html>  

be 动词的一般现在时否定句式的构成是在 be 后直接加 not （可以缩写），其一般疑问句式是把 be 提至句首。其变化形式可以归纳如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td><td>疑问句</td></tr><tr><td>一</td><td>I am Chinese.</td><td>I am not Chinese.</td><td>Am I Chinese?</td></tr><tr><td>He / She / It</td><td>He / She is an English boy / girl. It is cheap.</td><td>He / She is not (isn't) an English boy / girl. It is not (isn't) cheap.</td><td>Is he / she an English boy / girl? Is it cheap?</td></tr><tr><td>We/ You / They</td><td>We are from America. You are a good boy. They are our friends.</td><td>We are not (aren't) from America. You are not (aren't) a good boy. They are not (aren't) our friends.</td><td>Are we from America? Are you a good boy? Are they our friends?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### Guide to the language use

一般说来，在一般现在时的表达中，be 动词可以用于以下几种情况：  

1) be $^ +$ 形容词 I am very happy. 我很幸福。 He is very kind. 他人非常好。 The fruit is very fresh. 这水果很新鲜。   
2) be $^ +$ 名词 Mr Wang is our English teacher. 王先生是我们的英语老师。 They are our friends. 他们是我们的朋友。 He is a very clever boy. 他是个非常聪明的男孩。   
3) be $^ +$ 介词短语 The book is on the desk. 书在桌子上。 She is at home. 她现在在家。 Are they from America? 他们是美国人吗？   
4) be $^ +$ 副词 Class is over. 下课了。 We are off now. Thanks for the meal! 我们要走了。谢谢款待 He is away to the ofce. 他走了，去办公室了。  

### 2. 行为动词的一般现在时

请看下面几个与同学们日常生活相关的句子：  

We go to school every day. 我们每天去上学。We clean our classroom after class. 下课后我们打扫教室。Sometimes we play football in the playground. 有时我们在操场上踢足球。这几个句子所谈论的都是平时经常发生的事情。表达这种经常性或习惯性的动作，就要使用一般现在时。如果表示的是现在的状态，也可以用一般现在时。例如：  

I know him very well. 我和他很熟。  

I like English very much. 我非常喜欢英语。第一人称和第二人称的一般现在时的谓语动词没有形式的变化，否定形式一般是在谓语动词前加do not（don’t）。例如：  

We go to school from Monday to Friday. We do not (don’t) go  

to school at the weekend.   
我们周一到周五上学，周末不上学。   
I don’t go to school on Sunday. I go to the park on Sunday. 我 周日不上学，去公园。  

单数第三人称行为动词一般现在时的肯定形式是在谓语动词后加-s或-es，否定形式是在动词前加 does not （doesn’t）。要注意单数第三人称否定形式中谓语动词要还原为原形，试比较其肯定与否定形式中行为动词形式的变化：  

肯定：He gets up very early. 他起床很早。否定：He doesn’t get up very early. 他起床不是很早。如果要询问某人是否经常做某事，我们采用下列表达方式：  

- Does he play the piano every day? 他每天都练钢琴吗？- No, he doesn’t. 不，他不是。  
- Does she go to school by bike? 她骑自行车上学吗？- Yes, she does. 是的，她是。  
- Does it eat meat? 它吃肉吗？  
- No, it doesn’t. 不，它不吃。  

从以上的例子可以看出，单数第三人称行为动词一般现在时的疑问形式是在句首加助动词 does，后面的谓语动词用动词原形。单数第三人称行为动词一般现在时的各种句式变化总结如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td><td>疑问句</td><td>回答</td></tr><tr><td>He speaks good English.</td><td>He does not (doesn't) speak good English.</td><td>Does he speak good English?</td><td>Yes, he does. No, he doesn't.</td></tr><tr><td>She lives in the city.</td><td>She does not (doesn't) live in the city.</td><td>Does she live in the city?</td><td>Yes, she does. No, she doesn't.</td></tr><tr><td>The panda comes from China.</td><td>The panda does not (doesn't) come from China.</td><td>Does the panda come from China?</td><td>Yes, it does. No, it doesn't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

### Guide to the language use

综观以上句子，我们了解了如何询问某人是否经常做某事。那么，如果询问如何做某事、在什么地方做某事等应如何表达呢？首先请看以下例句：  

How do I write my homework on the computer? 我如何在电脑 上写作业？  

Where do I write the name? 我在什么地方写名字？  

When do you use a computer? 你什么时候使用电脑？从上面的句子我们可以看出，在询问方式、地点或时间等时，把表示方式、地点或时间等的疑问词置于句首，后面句子的结构顺序与一般疑问句式的一致。  

### Unit 5

### 现在进行时

如果要表达现在正在做的事情该用什么句式呢？动词有没有什么变化？首先让我们来看几个例子：  

Tony is eating a delicious ice cream. Tony正在吃一个美味的冰激凌。   
Daming is having lunch. 大明正在吃午饭。   
We are playing football. 我们正在踢足球。  

以上例子都用了现在进行时表示正在做的事情。可以看出，现在进行时采用be $^ +$ 动词-ing的形式。其中 be 的变化与上一单元学过的 be 随人称变化而变化的规律一样，动词-ing形式的变化规律如下表所示：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>规则</td><td>示例</td></tr><tr><td>一般情况下，动词后直接加-ing</td><td>working, buying, visiting, talking, saying</td></tr><tr><td>以字母e结尾的动词，去掉e，然后加-ing</td><td>taking, having, leaving, driving, writing, making</td></tr><tr><td>以辅音字母+元音字母+辅音字母的重读 闭音节结尾的动词，如果末尾只有一个辅 音字母，双写这个辅音字母，然后加-ing</td><td>stopping, shopping, sitting, getting</td></tr><tr><td>特殊变化</td><td>lie - lying</td></tr></table></body></html>  

既然在谓语部分用了 be，结合前面的例句我们不难得出：现在进行时的肯定和否定形式构成与我们学过的 be 的相关句式构成是一样的，如下表所示：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td></tr><tr><td>I am writing a letter.</td><td>I am not writing a letter.</td></tr><tr><td>He/ She is listening to music.</td><td>He/ She is not (isn't) listening to music</td></tr><tr><td>We are enjoying our trip.</td><td>We are not (aren't) enjoying our trip.</td></tr><tr><td>They are talking to each other.</td><td>They are not (aren't) talking to each other.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

如果要询问对方是否在做某事，或是询问对方在做什么，我们要采用现在进行时的疑问句形式。根据现在进行时的构成特点，其一般疑问句采用如下表达方式：  

Is she doing her homework? 她在做作业吗？  

Are you listening to music? 你（们）在听音乐吗？  

Are they learning English? 他们在学习英语吗？其回答方式也与含有动词 be 的疑问句式的回答一样，如下表所示：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>疑问句</td><td>回答</td></tr><tr><td>Is she cleaning the house?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Are you getting ready for the Spring Festival?</td><td>Yes, l am /we are. No, I'm not/we aren't.</td></tr><tr><td>Are they sweeping the floor?</td><td>Yes, they are. No, they aren't.</td></tr><tr><td>Are the boysmaking lanterns?</td><td>Yes, they are. No, they aren't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

如果要问对方在做什么，我们可以这样说：  

What are you doing? 你（们）在做什么？问其他人在做什么：  

What are they doing? 他们在做什么？What is he doing? 他在做什么？  

### Unit 6

### 一般将来时：be going to / will

### 1. be going to

如果想表达自己打算做某事、计划做某事或者有意做某事，可以用 begoing to do sth 的结构，例如：  

I’m going to check my email this evening. 我打算今天晚上查看 电子邮件。  

He is going to have a piano lesson this weekend. 他这个周末有 堂钢琴课。  

They are going to have a picnic this weekend. 他们这个周末会去 野餐。  

be going to 在句中一般用在其他动词之前。be going to的肯定、否定和一般疑问句及其答句形式，参见下表：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td><td>一般疑问句</td><td>回答</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to visit the museum.</td><td>l am not going to visit the museum.</td><td>Am I going to visit the museum?</td><td>Yes, l am. No, I'm not.</td></tr><tr><td>You are going to the park tomorrow.</td><td>You are not going to the park tomorrow.</td><td>Are you going to the park tomorrow?</td><td>Yes, you are. No, you aren't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>He / She is going to buy some clothes.</td><td>He/She is not going to buy any clothes.</td><td>Is he / she going to buy any clothes?</td><td>Yes,he/ she is. No,he/ she isn't.</td></tr><tr><td>It is going to rain.</td><td>It is not going to rain.</td><td></td><td>Is it going to rain? Yes, it is. No, it isn't.</td></tr><tr><td>We are going to have a picnic.</td><td>We are not going to have a picnic.</td><td>have a picnic?</td><td>No, we aren't.</td></tr><tr><td>They are going to have a party.</td><td>They are not going to have a party.</td><td>Are they going to have a party?</td><td>Yes, they are.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

如果要询问某人在将来某一段时间打算做什么，一般要说：  

What is he going to do this afternoon? 他今天下午要做什么？  

What are you going to do this weekend? 你这个周末要做什么？  

What are they going to do this evening? 他们今天晚上要做什么？根据询问的具体情况，可以在句首加不同的疑问词，例如：  

When is Helen going to visit her granddaughter in China? Helen 什么时候去中国看望她的孙女？  

Where is he going to have his birthday party? 他要在哪里办生日 聚会？  

如果表示计划到某地去，由于谓语动词 go 与 going 重复，一般可以只说“be going to $^ +$ 地点”，例如：  

We are going to Hong Kong for a holiday. 我们要去香港度假。  

They are going to China for a visit. 他们要出访中国。  

### 2. will

如果我们想描述未来的事情或表达对将来的预测等，该采用什么方式呢？我们可以用“will $^ +$ 动词原形”来表达，例如：  

There will be a robot in every family in the future. 将来每个家庭 都会有一个机器人。  

Planes will be very large, so flying will be very cheap. 飞机将会 很大，所以坐飞机会很便宜。  

### Guide to the language use

It will probably be hot all year. 很可能一整年都很热。从以上例句可以看出，will不随人称和主语的单复数变化而变化。如果要表达“将来不会…… ”，就要用其否定形式，可以在 will 后直接加not，构成 will not，或缩略为won’t。例如：  

Students will study on the internet. They won’t use books. 学生将在网上学习。他们将不使用书了。  

The teachers won’t write on the blackboard with chalk. 老师将 不会再用粉笔在黑板上写字了。  

如果询问将来的事，我们就要用其疑问句形式。一般疑问句是把 will 提到句首，例如：  

Will students go to school in the future? 将来学生还会上学吗？Will there be robot teachers in school? 将来学校里会有机器人教师吗？  
Will people do all things on the internet? 人们会在互联网上做所有事情吗？  

下面我们将 will 的肯定、否定和一般疑问句及其答句形式总结如下：  

<html><body><table><tr><td>肯定句</td><td>否定句</td><td>一般疑问句</td><td>回答</td></tr><tr><td>I will have many presents.</td><td>I will not (won't) have many</td><td>Will I have many presents?</td><td>Yes, I will. No, I won't.</td></tr><tr><td>You will write a book. book.</td><td>You will not (won't) write a</td><td>Will you write a book?</td><td>Yes, you will. No, you won't.</td></tr><tr><td>He / She will do exciting jobs.</td><td>He / She will not (won't) do exciting jobs.</td><td>Will he / she do exciting jobs?</td><td>Yes, he / she will. No,he/ she won't.</td></tr><tr><td>It will happen.</td><td>It will not (won't) happen.</td><td>Will it happen?</td><td>Yes, it will. No, it won't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>We will win.</td><td>We will not (won't) win.</td><td>Will we win?</td><td>Yes, we will. No, we won't.</td></tr><tr><td>They will do heavy work.</td><td>They will not (won't) do heavy work.</td><td>Will they do heavy work?</td><td>Yes, they will. No, they won't.</td></tr><tr><td>There will be a robot in every family.</td><td>There will not (won't) be a robot in every family.</td><td>Will there be a robot in every family?</td><td>Yes, there will. No, there won't.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

will的特殊疑问句结构为“疑问词 $^ +$ will $^ +$ 主语 $^ +$ 谓语（ $^ +$ 宾语）”。  

例如：  

When will you come? 你什么时候来？Where will they go for a trip? 他们会去哪里旅行？
