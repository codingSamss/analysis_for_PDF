I love elephants because they are strong and clever. They are also a symbol of good luck here. The elephant is our national animal. On 13 March, we celebrate Thai Elephant Day.  \n\nElephants look very different from other animals. They are huge. They have large ears and long trunks. They can pick up and carry heavy things with their trunks.  \n\nElephants are like us in some ways. They are very playful and love to play in the water. They are great swimmers. They are also clever. For example, they can remember one another and places with food and water after many years. Elephants are very kind too. They look after other elephants when they don’t feel well. The big elephants also help the baby ones.  \n\nElephants are an important part of Thai life and culture. However, they are in danger. They live in forests, but people cut down too many trees. People also kill elephants for their ivory. Let’s save the forests and not buy things made of ivory. Every elephant counts.",

We encourage one another to do tricks. Some tricks are difficult, but once you succeed, you feel great! I like skateboarding because it keeps me fit.  \n\nThis year, my goal is to be really fit. I jog, swim, and do sit-ups. But my favourite way of keeping fit is to to work out. The app gives me exercises to do  \n\nevery day. It can show my progress. My friends use the app too. We have fun when we keep fit together!  \n\nI’m in my school’s baseball club, so I quite often. It’s my favourite sport. We play many matches. The other teams are great, but I think ours is the best! We usually practise three times a week after school. We also exercise a lot because it keeps us fit and helps us play better.  \n\nBaseball also builds team spirit.

Both what we eat and how we eat are important!  \n\nFor example, some people have fast food every week. It is easy and delicious! But it often has lots of salt, fat, and sugar. That makes us put on weight. Eating fast food like pizza and hamburgers too often may cause heart problems later. If you cook your own meals instead, you can make healthy balanced meals.  \n\nEating three meals a day is important. But some people don’t have breakfast. Maybe they don’t feel hungry in the morning, or they are too busy to eat anything. But food gives us energy. It is easy to feel sleepy and find it hard to focus on our work or studies if we don’t eat breakfast.  \n\nSome people also eat too many sweet things. Ice cream, sweets, and chocolate are delicious, but they usually have lots of sugar. This can cause tooth problems. When you want a snack, why don’t you have some fruit instead? After all, an apple a day keeps the doctor away.  \n\nRemember: You are what you eat. Healthy eating means eating healthy food and having good eating habits.",

The work seemed easy, but it took time to get it right. Slowly, we filled many baskets. In the afternoon, the farmer taught us how to cut branches and leaves from tomato plants. This helps them to grow more fruit. Finally, we watered the plants. Plants need so much work! It was tiring, but I enjoyed working with my hands.  \n\nOne thing I learnt today: Farming isn’t easy! It made me think of the saying,“Every grain comes from hard work.”The farmer let us take some vegetables home. My mum cooked some for dinner, and they were fresh and delicious!

But the other ducklings still laughed at him and told him to go away. It made the poor duckling very sad, so he decided to search for a new home. He met many other birds, but all of them thought that he was ugly too. They did not want him to live with them.  \n\nOne day, the duckling met a cat and a hen. “May I stay with you?” he asked hopefully. But the two animals said no. They did not like him because he could not purr or lay eggs!  \n\nSome days later, the ugly duckling came to a lake. There, he saw three beautiful swans with long necks and white feathers. “I wish I looked like you!” he cried. “My friend, you do look like us! Look in the water!” one of the swans said.

The smallest is only around 2.5 centimetres long, but some octopuses can grow up to more than five metres long. There was even an octopus over nine metres long!  \n\nThe octopus’s body is very interesting. All octopuses have eight arms. Their brain is not just in their head, but also in their arms! This helps them to think about and do more than one thing at once. Octopuses can also fit into small places because they do not have any bones! And did you know that octopuses have three hearts? These hearts work with different parts of the body.  \n\nOctopuses can also do many amazing things. Most of them can change their colour and shape to look like plants or other sea animals, and they can also make ink. They keep it inside a very small bag in their body. When they produce ink, the ink makes it hard for other animals to see them. This helps the octopuses to get away fast. What’s more, when an octopus loses an arm, it can grow it back!  \n\nStudying amazing animals like the octopus is important because we can learn a lot from them. But they also show us how wonderful nature is and why it is important to protect it!",

But we should try our best to exercise every day.  \n\nExercise is good for our body. When we exercise, our body changes. Exercise develops our muscles and makes us stronger. When we exercise, we use energy. This keeps our weight down. Being overweight puts stress on our body. It can cause pain in our back and knees, and even cause more serious problems such as heart disease later in life.  \n\nExercise is also great for our brain. During exercise, our heart beats faster and we breathe harder. Our brain gets more oxygen because of this, and that helps our memory improve. Scientists also tell us the body makes more of certain chemicals after exercise. This helps us to learn and think well. So, when you have trouble with your homework, do some exercise, then try again!  \n\nExercise also helps us to feel happier. When we exercise, our brain makes special chemicals. These chemicals can relax our body and calm our mind. Feeling fit can also make us feel better and more confident about ourselves. When we play a sport with others, we can even make new friends.  \n\nRemember: Health is wealth. The more you exercise, the healthier you become. Try to make exercise a part of your life.",

The Chinese Food Guide Pagoda shows us what food we should eat. While fruit and vegetables are healthy choices, it is just as important to eat foods from other food groups. Milk,  \n\nfor example, contains many nutrients and is good for our bones. We should include milk or dairy products among the things we eat.  \n\n “Eating fat makes you fat.”  \n\nEating fat is important for keeping us healthy. It gives us energy and helps our body to take in nutrients. Not all fat makes us gain weight. Some fat can even encourage our body to lose weight. It is necessary to include some, but not too much, fat in our food to help our body work well.  \n\n “It’s OK to eat only what I like while I’m young.”  \n\nWhen we are young, it might feel like we can just eat whatever we want! For example, sweets and fried foods taste delicious. But we cannot eat those foods alone. Eating balanced meals is very important when we are young. It helps our body and brain to grow well. Bad eating habits may stay with us our whole life, so it is best to develop good eating habits early!",

It is a big part of our lives!  \n\nWe often use weather language to describe how we feel. For example, if we are feeling ill, we say we are “under the weather”. If we are feeling stressed and busy, we can say that we are “snowed under”. We use “bad” weather (rainy, stormy, etc.) to describe a bad mood, and “good” weather (sunny, warm, etc.) to describe a good mood.  \n\nAnd that is not all. The weather can even change the way we feel! For example, sunlight helps our body to produce vitamin D. This vitamin can improve our mood. But some parts of the world get little sunlight in winter, so people can feel unusually sad then. However, when it is hot and sunny, some people may get angry easily too! Scientists are still studying how the weather changes the way people feel and behave.  \n\nThese days, many of us spend less time outside than in the past. Getting no fresh air or sunlight and spending too much time inside can make us feel down. It is very important to go outside once in a while, whatever the weather, rain or shine!",

The crowd gasped and cheered. The light of the sun made a ring of light around the moon. I took this photograph then. The total eclipse lasted for over five minutes!
